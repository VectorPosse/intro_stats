    "text": "History and goals\nIn 2015, a group of interdisciplinary faculty at Westminster University (then called Westminster College) in Salt Lake City, Utah, started a process that led to the creation of a new Data Science program. Preparatory to creating a more rigorous introductory statistics course using the statistical software R, I wrote a series of 22 modules that filled a gap in the R training literature. Most R training at the time was focused either on learning to program using R as a computer language, or using R to do sophisticated statistical analysis. We needed our students to use R as a tool for elementary statistical methods and we needed the learning curve to be as gentle as possible. I decided early on that to make the modules more useful, they needed to be structured more like an interactive textbook rather than just a series of lab exercises, and so I spent the summer of 2016 writing a free, open-source, self-contained, and nearly fully-featured introductory statistics textbook. The first sections of the newly-created DATA 220 were offered in Fall, 2016, using the materials I created.\nSince then, I have been revising and updating the modules a little every semester. At some point, however, it became clear that some big changes needed to happen:\n\nThe modules were more or less aligned with the OpenIntro book Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation (ISRS) by David Diez, Christopher Barr, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. That book has now been supplanted by Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin, also published through the OpenIntro project.\nThe initial materials were written mostly using a mix of base R tools, some tidyverse tools, and the amazing resources of the mosaic package. I wanted to convert everything to be more aligned with tidyverse packages now that they are mature, well-supported, and becoming a de facto standard for doing data analysis in R.\nThe initial choice of data sets that served as examples and exercises for students was guided by convenience. As I had only a short amount of time to write an entire textbook from scratch, I tended to grab the first data sets I could find that met the conditions needed for the statistical principles I was trying to illustrate. It has become clear in the last few years that the material will be more engaging with more interesting data sets. Ideally, we should use at least some data sets that speak to issues of social justice.\nMaking statistics more inclusive requires us to confront some ugly chapters in the development of the subject. Statistical principles are often named after people. (These are supposedly the people who “discovered” the principle, but keep in mind Stigler’s Law of Eponymy which states that no scientific discovery is truly named after its original discoverer. In a neat bit of self-referential irony, Stephen Stigler was not the first person to make this observation.) The beliefs of some of these people were problematic. For example, Francis Galton (famous for the concept of “regression to the mean”), Karl Pearson (of the Pearson correlation coefficient), and Ronald Fisher (famous for many things, including the P-value) were all deeply involved in the eugenics movement of the late 19th and early 20th century. The previous modules almost never referenced this important historical background and context. Additionally, it’s important to discuss ethics, whether that be issues of data provenance, data manipulation, choice of analytic techniques, framing conclusions, and many other topics.\n\nThe efforts of my revisions are here online. I’ve tried to address all the concerns mentioned above:\n\nThe chapter are arranged to align somewhat with IMS. There isn’t quite a one-to-one correspondence, but teachers who want to use the chapters of my book to supplement instruction from IMS, or vice versa, should be able to do so pretty easily. In the Appendix, I’ve included a concordance that shows how the books’ chapters match up, along with some notes that explain when one book does more or less than the other.\nThe book is now completely aligned with the tidyverse and other packages that are designed to integrate into the tidyverse. All plotting is done with ggplot2 and all data manipulation is done with dplyr, tidyr, and forcats. Tables are created using tabyl from the janitor package. Inference is taught using the cool tools in the infer package.\nI have made an effort to find more interesting data sets. It’s tremendously difficult to find data that is both fascinating on its merits and also meets the pedagogical requirements of an introductory statistics course. I would like to use even more data that addresses social justice issues. There’s some in the book now, and I plan to incorporate even more in the future as I come across data sets that are suitable.\nWhen statistical tools are introduced, I have tried to give a little historical context about their development if I can. I’ve also tried to frame every step of the inferential process as a decision-making process that requires not only analytical expertise, but also solid ethical grounding. Again, there’s a lot more I could do here, and my goal is to continue to develop more such discussion as I can in future revisions.\n\nNow, instead of a bunch of separate module files, all the material is gathered in one place as chapters of a book. In each chapter (starting with Chapter 2), students can download the chapter as a Quarto document, open it in RStudio, and work through the material.",

    "section": "Philosophy and pedagogy",
    "text": "Philosophy and pedagogy\nTo understand my statistics teaching philosophy, it’s worth telling you a little about my background in statistics.\nAt the risk of undermining my own credibility, I’d like to tell you about the first statistics class I took. In the mid-2000s, I was working on my Ph.D. at the University of California, San Diego, studying geometric topology. To make a little extra money and get some teaching experience under my belt, I started teaching night and summer classes at Miramar College, a local community college in the San Diego Community College District. I had been there for several semesters, mostly teaching pre-calculus, calculus, and other lower-division math classes. One day, I got a call from my department chair with my assignment for the upcoming semester. I was scheduled to teach intro stats. I was about to respond, “Oh, I’ve never taken a stats class before.” But remembering this was the way I earned money to be able to live in expensive San Diego County, I said, “Sounds great. By the way, do you happen to have an extra copy of the textbook we’ll be using?”\nYes, the first statistics class I took was the one I taught. Not ideal, I know.\nI was lucky to start teaching with Intro Stats by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock, a book that was incredibly well-written and included a lot of resources for teachers like me. (I learned quickly that I wasn’t the only math professor in the world who got thrown into teaching statistics classes with little-to-no training.) I got my full-time appointment at Westminster in 2008 and continued to teach intro stats classes for many years to follow. As I mentioned earlier, we started the Data Science program at Westminster in 2016 and moved everything from our earlier hodgepodge of calculators, spreadsheets, and SPSS, over to R.\nEventually, I got interested in Bayesian statistics and read everything I could get my hands on. I became convinced that Bayesian statistics is the right way to do statistical analysis. I started teaching special topics courses in Bayesian Data Analysis and working with students on research projects that involved Bayesian methods. If it were up to me, every introductory statistics class in the world would be taught using Bayesian methods. I know that sounds like a strong statement. (And I put it in boldface, so it looks even stronger.) But I truly believe that in an alternate universe where Fisher and his disciples didn’t “win” the stats wars of the 20th century (and perhaps one in which computing power got a little more advanced a little earlier in the development of statistics), we would all be Bayesians. Bayesian thinking is far more intuitive and more closely aligned with our intuitions about probabilities and uncertainty.\nUnfortunately, our current universe timeline didn’t play out that way. So we are left with frequentism. It’s not that I necessarily object to frequentist tools. All tools are just tools, after all. However, the standard form of frequentist inference, with its null hypothesis significance testing, P-values, and confidence intervals, can be confusing. It’s bad enough that professional researchers struggle with them. We teach undergraduate students in introductory classes.\nOkay, so we are stuck not in the world we want but in the world we’ve got. At my institution and most others, intro stats is a service course that trains far more people who are outside the fields of mathematics and statistics. In that world, students will go on to careers where they interact with research that reports P-values and confidence intervals.\nSo what’s the best we can do for our students, given that limitation? We need to be laser-focused on teaching the frequentist logic of inference the best we can. I want student to see P-values in papers and know how to interpret those P-values correctly. I want students to understand what a confidence interval tells them—and even more importantly, what it does not tell them. I want students to respect the severe limitations inherent in tests of significance. If we’re going to train frequentists, the least we can do is help them become good frequentists.\nOne source of inspiration for good statistical pedagogy comes from the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE), a set of recommendations made by experienced stats educators and endorsed by the American Statistical Association. Their college guidelines are as follows:\n\nTeach statistical thinking.\n\nTeach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making.\nGive students experience with multivariable thinking.\n\nFocus on conceptual understanding.\nIntegrate real data with a context and purpose.\nFoster active learning.\nUse technology to explore concepts and analyze data.\nUse assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.\n\nIn every element of this book, I’ve tried to follow these guidelines:\n\nThe first part of the book is an extensive guide for exploratory data analysis. The rest of the book is about inference in the context of specific research questions that are answered using statistical tools. While multivariable thinking is a little harder to do in an intro stats class, I take the opportunity whenever possible to use graphs to explore more variables than we can handle with intro stats inferential techniques. I point out the the simple analyses taught in this class are only the first step in more comprehensive analyses that incorporate more information and control for confounders. I emphasize that students can continue their statistical growth by enrolling in more advanced stats classes.\nI often tell students that if they forget everything else from their stats class, the one think I want them to be able to do is interpret a P-value correctly. It’s not intuitive, so it takes an entire semester to set up the idea of a sampling distribution and explain over and over again how the P-value relates to it. In this book, I try to reinforce the logic of inference until the students know it almost instinctively. A huge pedagogical advantage is derived by using randomization and simulation to keep students from getting lost in the clouds of theoretical probability distributions. But they also need to know about the latter too. Every hypothesis test is presented both ways, a task made easy when using the infer package.\nThis is the thing I struggle with the most. Finding good data is hard. Over the years, I’ve found a few data sets I really like, but my goal is to continue to revise the book to incorporate more interesting data, especially data that serves to highlight issues of social justice.\nBack when I wrote the first set of modules that eventually became this book, the goal was to create assignments that merged content with activities so that students would be engaged in active learning. When these chapters are used in the classroom, students can collaborate with each other and with their professor. They learn by doing.\nUnlike most books out there, this book does not try to be agnostic about technology. This book is about doing statistics in R.\nThis one I’ll leave in the capable hands of the professors who use these materials. The chapter assignments should be completed and submitted, and that is one form of assessment. But I also believe in augmenting this material with other forms of assessment that may include supplemental assignments, open-ended data exploration, quizzes and tests, projects, etc.",

    "section": "Course structure",
    "text": "Course structure\nAs explained above, this book is meant to be a workbook that students complete as they’re reading.\nAt Westminster University, we use Posit Cloud. The cloud solution has a free tier, but in our experience, it’s not quite enough compute hours for this course. Various affordable paid options are available, like having students pay a monthly fee for access, or having the institution pay for the accounts.\nIn the past, we’ve also hosted Posit Workbench on a local server that is connected to our single sign-on (SSO) systems so that students can access RStudio through a browser using their campus online usernames and passwords. If you have the ability to convince your IT folks to support such a server, it’s very helpful. Rather than spending the first day of class troubleshooting while students try to install software on their machines, you can just have them log in and get started right away. Campus admins install packages and tweak settings to make sure all students have a standardized interface and consistent experience.\nIf you don’t have that luxury, or if you don’t want to pay for the cloud accounts, you will need to have students download and install both R and RStudio. The installation processes for both pieces of software are very easy and straightforward for the majority of students. If your students are running R on their own machines or if they’re using Posit Cloud, they will need to use install.packages at the beginning of some of the chapters for any new packages that are introduced. (They are mentioned at the beginning of each chapter with instructions for installing them.)\nChapter 1 is fully online and introduces R and RStudio very gently using only commands at the Console. They will create a project called intro_stats in RStudio that should be used all semester to organize their work. There is a reminder at the beginning of all subsequent chapter to make sure they are in that project before starting to do any work. (Generally, there is no reason they will exit the project, but some students get curious and click on stuff.)\nIn Chapter 2, students are taught to click a link to download a Quarto document (.qmd). I have found that students struggle initially to get this file to the right place. If students are using RStudio online, they will need to use the “Upload” button in the Files tab in RStudio to get the file from their Downloads folder (or wherever they tell their machine to put downloaded files from the internet) into RStudio. If students are using R on their own machines, they will need to move the file from their Downloads folder into their project directory. There are some students who have never had to move files around on their computers, so this is a task that might require some guidance from classmates, TAs, or the professor. The location of the project directory and the downloaded files can vary from one machine to the next. They will have to use something like File Explorer for Windows or the Finder for MacOS, so there isn’t a single set of instructions that will get all students’ files successfully in the right place. Once the file is in the correct location, students can just click on it to open it in RStudio and start reading. Chapter 2 is all about using Quarto documents: markdown syntax, R code chunks, and inline code.\nBy Chapter 3, a rhythm is established that students will start to get used to:\n\nOpen the book online and open RStudio.\nInstall any packages in RStudio that are new to that chapter.\nCheck to make sure they’re are in the intro_stats project.\nClick the link online to download the Quarto document.\nMove the Quarto document from the Downloads folder to the project directory.\nOpen up the Quarto document.\nRestart R and Run All Chunks.\nStart reading and working.\n\nWhen students finish each assignment, they will Restart R and Run All Chunks one last time and then “Render” the Quarto document, which will create HTML output that can then be submitted. (Hopefully, they will also take the opportunity to spell check and proofread thoroughly before submission. It’s important to proofread the HTML document not just for the writing, but also to make sure that the code output and formatting all looks correct.)\nChapters 3 and 4 focus on exploratory data analysis for categorical and numerical data, respectively.\nChapter 5 is a primer on data manipulation using dplyr.\nChapters 6 and 7 cover correlation and regression. This “early regression” approach mirrors the IMS text. (IMS eventually circles back to hypothesis testing for regression, but this book does not. That’s a topic that is covered extensively in most second-semester stats classes.)\nChapters 8–11 are crucial for building the logical foundations for inference. The idea of a sampling distribution under the assumption of a null hypothesis is built up slowly and intuitively through randomization and simulation. By the end of Chapter 11, students will be fully introduced to the structure of a hypothesis test, and hopefully will have experienced the first sparks of intuition about why it “works.” All inference in this book is conducted using a “rubric” approach—basically, the steps are broken down into bite-sized pieces and students are expected to work through each step of the rubric every time they run a test. (The rubric steps are shown in the Appendix.)\nChapter 12 introduces a few more steps to the rubric for confidence intervals. As we are still using randomization to motivate inference, confidence intervals are calculated using the bootstrap approach for now.\nOnce students have developed a conceptual intuition for sampling distributions using simulation, we can introduce probability models. Chapter 13 introduces normal models and Chapter 14 explains why they are often appropriate for modeling sampling distributions.\nThe final chapters of the book (Chapters 15–22) are simply applications of inference in specific data settings: inference for one (Ch. 15) and two (Ch. 16) proportions, Chi-square tests for goodness-of-fit (Ch. 17) and independence (Ch. 18), inference for one mean (Ch. 19), paired data (Ch. 20), two independent means (Ch. 21), and finally ANOVA (Ch. 22). Along the way, students learn about the chi-square, Student t, and F distributions. Although the last part of the book follows a fairly traditional parametric approach, every chapter still includes randomization and simulation to some degree so that students don’t lose track of the intuition behind sampling distributions under the assumption of a null hypothesis.",

The goal of this course is not to make you a computer programmer. To use R to do statistics, you don’t need know anything about programming at all. Every chapter throughout the whole course will give you examples of the commands you need to use. All you have to do is use those example commands as templates and make the necessary changes to adapt them to the data you’re trying to analyze.\nThe greatest thing about R is that it is free and open source. This means that you can download it and use it for free, and also that you can inspect and modify the source code for all R functions. This kind of transparency does not exist in commercial software. The net result is a robust, secure, widely-used language with literally tens of thousands of contributions from R users all over the world.\nR has also become a standard tool for statistical analysis, from academia to industry to government. Although some commercial packages are still widely used, many practitioners are switching to R due to its cost (free!) and relative ease of use. After this course, you will be able to list some R experience on your résumé and your future employer will value this. It might even help get you a job!",

    "text": "1.3 RStudio\nRStudio is an “Integrated Development Environment,” or IDE for short. An IDE is a tool for working with a programming language that is fancier than just a simple text editor. Most IDEs give you shortcuts, menus, debugging facilities, syntax highlighting, and other things to make your life as easy as possible.\nOpen RStudio so we can explore some of the areas you’ll be using in the future. (How to do this will depend on whether you’ve installed RStudio on your personal computer or logged into a cloud server. If you are in a class, your teacher will explain how to do this. For local installations, you should just be able to open RStudio. For cloud applications, you may need to start a “New Session” or a “New Project”.)\nIt should look something like this:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of RStudio at startup\n\n\nOn the left side of your screen, you should see a big pane called the “Console”. There will be some startup text there, and below that, you should see a “command prompt”: the symbol “&gt;” followed by a blinking cursor. (If the cursor is not blinking, that means that the focus is in another pane. Click anywhere in the Console and the cursor should start blinking again.)\nA command prompt can be one of the more intimidating things about starting to use R. It’s just sitting there waiting for you to do something. Unlike other programs where you run commands from menus, R requires you to know what you need to type to make it work.\nWe’ll return to the Console in a moment.\nNext, look at the upper-right corner of the screen. There are at least three tabs in this pane starting with “Environment”, “History”, and “Connections”. The “Environment” (also called the “Global Environment”) keeps track of things you define while working with R. There’s nothing to see there yet because we haven’t defined anything! The “History” tab will likewise be empty; again, we haven’t done anything yet. We won’t use the “Connections” tab in this course. (Depending on the version of RStudio you are using and its configuration, you may see additional tabs, but we won’t need them for this course.)\nNow look at the lower-right corner of the screen. There are likely six tabs here: “Files”, “Plots”, “Packages”, “Help”, “Viewer”, and “Presentation”. The “Files” tab will eventually contain the files you upload or create. “Plots” will show you the result of commands that produce graphs and charts. “Packages” will be explained later. “Help” is precisely what it sounds like; this will be a very useful place for you to get to know. We will never use the “Viewer” or “Presentation” tabs, so don’t worry about them.",

    "text": "1.5 Try something!\nSo let’s do something in R! Go back to the Console and at the command prompt (the “&gt;” symbol with the blinking cursor), type\n\n1+1\n\nand hit Enter.\nCongratulations! You just ran your first command in R. It’s all downhill from here. R really is nothing more than a glorified calculator.\nOkay, let’s do something slightly more sophisticated. It’s important to note that R is case-sensitive, which means that lowercase letters and uppercase letters are treated differently. Type the following, making sure you use a lowercase x and lowercase c, and hit Enter:\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 3, 4, 7, 9)\n\nYou have just created a “vector”. When we use the letter c and enclose a list of things in parentheses, we tell R to “combine” those elements. So, a vector is just a collection of data. The little arrow &lt;- says to take what’s on the right and assign it to the symbol on the left. The vector x is now saved in memory. As long as you don’t terminate your current R session, this vector is available to you.\nCheck out the “Environment” pane now. You should see the vector x that you just created, along with some information about it. Next to x, it says num, which means your vector has numerical data. Then it says [1:5] which indicates that there are five elements in the vector x.\nAt the command prompt in the Console, type\n\nx\n\nand hit Enter. Yup, x is there. R knows what it is. You may be wondering about the [1] that appears at the beginning of the line. To see what that means, try typing this (and hit Enter—at some point here I’m going to stop reminding you to hit Enter after everything you type):\n\ny &lt;- letters\n\nR is clever, so the alphabet is built in under the name letters.\nType\n\ny\n\nNow can you see what the [1] meant above? Assuming the letters spilled onto more than one line of the Console, you should see a number in brackets at the beginning of each line telling you the numerical position of the first entry in each new line.\nSince we’ve done a few things, check out the “Global Environment” in the upper-right corner. You should see the two objects we’ve defined thus far, x and y. Now click on the “History” tab. Here you have all the commands you have run so far. This can be handy if you need to go back and re-run an earlier command, or if you want to modify an earlier command and it’s easier to edit it slightly than type it all over again. To get an older command back into the Console, either double-click on it, or select it and click the “To Console” button at the top of the pane.\nWhen we want to re-use an old command, it has usually not been that long since we last used it. In this case, there is an even more handy trick. Click in the Console so that the cursor is blinking at the blank command prompt. Now hit the up arrow on your keyboard. Do it again. Now hit the down arrow once or twice. This is a great way to access the most recently used commands from your command history.\nLet’s do something with x. Type\n\nsum(x)\n\nI bet you figured out what just happened.\nNow try\n\nmean(x)\n\nWhat if we wanted to save the mean of those five numbers for use later? We can assign the result to another variable! Type the following and click on the Environment tab to observe the effect.\n\nm &lt;- mean(x)\n\nIt makes no difference what letter or combination of letters we use to name our variables. For example,\n\nmean_x &lt;- mean(x)\n\njust saves the mean to a differently named variable. In general, variable names can be any combination of characters that are letters, numbers, underscore symbols (_), and dots (.). (In this course, we will prefer underscores over dots.) You cannot use spaces or any other special characters in the names of variables.1 You should avoid variable names that are the same words as predefined R functions; for example, we should not type mean &lt;- mean(x).",

For example, we would like to use the palmerpenguins package because it includes an interesting data set on penguins.\nType the following at the command prompt in the Console:2\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\nWe are doing this because you’ve never used the palmerpenguins package before. Once a package is installed, though, it never has to be installed again.\nAfter we’ve installed the package (the one-time process we completed above), we will need to load the package in every R session in which we want to use it. For example, the palmerpenguins package contains a data set called penguins. Let’s see what happens when we try to access this data set without loading the package that contains it. Typing this will produce an error:\n\npenguins\n\nThat error makes sense because R doesn’t know anything about a data set called penguins.\nBut since the palmerpenguins package has been installed, you can now type this at the command prompt:\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nIt didn’t look like anything happened. However, in the background, all the stuff in the palmerpenguins package became available to use.\nLet’s test that claim. Hit the up arrow twice and get back to where you see this at the Console (or you can manually re-type it, but that’s no fun!):\n\npenguins\n\nNow R knows about the penguins data, so the last command printed some of it to the Console.\nGo look at the “Packages” tab in the pane in the lower-right corner of the screen. Scroll down a little until you get to the “P”s. You should be able to find the palmerpenguins package. You’ll also notice a check mark by it, indicating that this package is loaded into your current R session.\nYou must use the library command in every new R session in which you want to use a package. If you terminate your R session, R forgets about the package. If you are ever in a situation where you are trying to use a command and you know you’re typing it correctly, but you’re still getting an error, check to see if the package containing that command has been loaded with library. (Many R commands are “base R” commands, meaning they come with R and no special package is required to access them. The set of letters you used above is one such example.)",

    "text": "1.7 Getting help\nThere are three important ways to get help with R. The first is the obvious “Help” tab in the lower-right pane on your screen. Click on that tab now. In the search bar at the right, type penguins and hit Enter. Take a few minutes to read the help file.\nHelp files are only as good as their authors. Fortunately, most package developers are conscientious enough to write decent help files. But don’t be surprised if the help file doesn’t quite tell you what you want to know. And for highly technical R functions, sometimes the help files are downright inscrutable. Try looking at the help file for the grep function. Can you honestly say you have any idea what this command does or how you might use it? Over time, as you become more knowledgeable about how R works, these help files get less mysterious.\nThe second way of getting help is from the Console. Go to the Console and type\n\n?letters\n\nThe question mark tells R you need help with the R command letters. This will bring up the help file in the same Help pane you were looking at before.\nSometimes, you don’t know exactly what the name of the command is. For example, suppose we misremembered the name and thought it was letter instead of letters. Try typing this:\n\n?letter\n\nYou should have received an error because there is no command called letter. Try this instead:\n\n??letter\n\nand scroll down a bit in the Help pane. Two question marks tell R not to be too picky about the spelling. This will bring up a whole bunch of possibilities in the Help pane, representing R’s best guess as to what you might be searching for. (In this case, it’s not easy to find. You’d have to know that the help file for letters appeared on a help page called base::Constants.)\nThe third way to get help—and often the most useful way—is to use your best friend, the internet. You don’t want to just type “R” into a search engine. (That’s the downside of using a single letter of the alphabet for the name of a programming language.) However, if you type “R __________” where you fill in the blank with the topic of interest, search engines usually do a pretty good job sending you to relevant pages. Within the first few hits, in fact, you’ll often see an online copy of the same help file you see in R. Frequently, the next few hits lead to StackOverflow where very knowledgeable people post very helpful responses to common questions.\nUse a search engine to find out how to take the square root of a number in R. Test out your newly-discovered function on a few numbers in the Console to make sure it works.",

    "section": "1.8 Understanding the data",
    "text": "1.8 Understanding the data\n\n\n\nAdélie Penguin, By Andrew Shiva / Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link\n\n\nLet’s go back to the penguins data contained in the penguins data set from the palmerpenguins package.\nThe first thing we do to understand a data set is to read the help file on it. (We’ve already done this for the penguins data.) Of course, this only works for data files that come with R or with a package that can be loaded into R. If you are using R to analyze your own data, presumably you don’t need a help file. And if you’re analyzing data from another source, you’ll have to go to that source to find out about the data.\nWhen you read the help file for penguins, you may have noticed that it described the “Format” as being “A tibble with 344 rows and 8 variables.” What is a “tibble”?\nThe word “tibble” is an R-specific term that describes data organized in a specific way. A more common term is “data frame” (or sometimes “data table”). The idea is that in a data frame, the rows and the columns have very specific interpretations.\nEach row of a data frame represents a single object or observation. So in the penguins data, each row represents a penguin. If you have survey data, each row will usually represent a single person. But an “object” can be anything about which we collect data. State-level data might have 50 rows and each row represents an entire state.\nEach column of a data frame represents a variable, which is a property, attribute, or measurement made about the objects in the data. For example, the help file mentions that various pieces of information are recorded about each penguin, like species, bill length, flipper length, body mass, sex, and so on. These are examples of variables. In a survey, for example, the variables will likely be the responses to individual questions.\nWe will use the terms tibble and data frame interchangeably in this course. They are not quite synonyms: tibbles are R-specific implementations of data frames, the latter being a more general term that applies in all statistical contexts. Nevertheless, there are no situations (at least not encountered in this course) where it makes any difference if a data set is called a tibble or a data frame.\nWe can also look at the data frame in “spreadsheet” form. Type\n\nView(penguins)\n\n(Be sure you’re using an upper-case “V” in View.) A new pane should open up in the upper-left corner of the screen. In that pane, the penguins data appears in a grid format, like a spreadsheet. The observations (individual penguins) are the rows and the variables (attributes and measurements about the penguins) are the columns. This will also let you sort each column by clicking on the arrows next to the variable name across the top.\nSometimes, we just need a little peek at the data. Try this to print just a few rows of data to the Console:\n\nhead(penguins)\n\nWe can customize this by specifying the number of rows to print. (Don’t forget about the up arrow trick!)\n\nhead(penguins, n = 10)\n\nThe tail command does something similar, but for data from the last few rows.\n\ntail(penguins)\n\nWhen we’re working with HTML documents like this one, it’s usually not necessary to use View, head, or tail because the HTML format will print the data frame a lot more neatly than it did in the Console. You do not need to type the following code; just look below it for the table that appears.\n\npenguins\n\nYou can scroll through the rows by using the numbers at the bottom or the “Next” button. You can scroll through the variables by clicking the little black arrow pointed to the right in the upper-right corner. The only thing you can’t do here that you can do with View is sort the columns.\nWe want to understand the “structure” of our data. For this, we use the str command. Try it:\n\nstr(penguins)\n\nThis tells us several important things. First it says that we are looking at a data frame with 344 observations of 8 variables. We can isolate those pieces of information separately as well, if needed:\n\nNROW(penguins)\n\n\nNCOL(penguins)\n\nThese give you the number of rows and columns, respectively.\nThe str command also tells us about each of the variables in our data set. We’ll talk about these later.\nWe need to be able to summarize variables in the data set. The summary command is one way to do it:\n\nsummary(penguins)\n\nYou may not recognize terms like “Median” or “1st Qu.” or “3rd Qu.” yet. Nevertheless, you can see why this summary could come in handy.",

    "section": "1.9 Understanding the variables",
    "text": "1.9 Understanding the variables\nWhen we want to look at only one variable at a time, we use the dollar sign to grab it. Try this:\n\npenguins$body_mass_g\n\nThis will list the entire body_mass_g column, in other words, the body masses (in grams) of all the penguins in this particular study. If we only want to see the first few, we can use head like before.\n\nhead(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\nIf we want the structure of the variable body_mass_g, we do this:\n\nstr(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\nNotice the letters int at the beginning of the line. That stands for “integer” which is another word for whole number. In other words, the penguins’ body masses all appear in this data set as whole numbers. There are other data types you’ll see in the future:\n\nnum: This is for general numerical data (which can be integers as well as having decimal parts).\nchr: This means “character”, used for character strings, which can be any sequence of letters or numbers. For example, if the researcher recorded some notes for each penguin, these notes would be recorded in a character variable.\nfactor: This is for categorical data, which is data that groups observations together into categories. For example, species is categorical. These are generally recorded like character strings, but factor variables have more structure because they take on a limited number of possible values corresponding to a generally small number of categories. We’ll learn a lot more about factor variables in future chapters.\n\nThere are other data types, but the ones above are by far the most common that you’ll encounter on a regular basis.\nIf we want to summarize only the variable body_mass_g, we can do this:\n\nsummary(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\nWhile executing the commands above, you may have noticed entries listed as NA. These are “missing” values. It is worth paying attention to missing values and thinking carefully about why they might be missing. For now, just make a mental note that NA is the code R uses for data that is missing. (This would be the same as a blank cell in a spreadsheet.)",

    "text": "1.10 Projects\nUsing files in R requires you to be organized. R uses what’s called a “working directory” to find the files it needs. Therefore, you can’t just put files any old place and expect R to be able to find them.\nOne way of ensuring that files are all located where R can find them is to organize your work into projects.\n\nIf you are using Posit Cloud, you have already created a project. It will say “Untitled project” at the top of the screen.\n\nClick on the words “Untitled project” and type “intro_stats”. You may skip the next set of bullet points.\n\nIf you are using a local installation of RStudio, look in the far upper-right corner of the RStudio screen. You should see some text that says Project: (None). This means we are not currently in a project and we need to to create one.\n\nOpen the drop-down menu here and select New Project. When the dialog box opens, select New Directory, then New Project. You’ll need to give your project a name. In this case, type intro_stats for the “Directory name”. Leave everything else alone and click Create Project. You will see the screen refresh and R will restart. If everything worked the way it should, creating a new project will create a new folder, put you in that folder, and automatically make it your working directory.\n\n\nIn general, project names should be descriptive—they should still remind you in several years what the project was about. The only thing to remember is that project names and file names should not have any spaces in them. In fact, you should avoid other kinds of special characters as well, like commas, number signs, etc. Stick to letters and numerals and you should be just fine. If you want a multi-word project name or file name, I recommend using underscores. R will allow you to name projects with spaces and modern operating systems are set up to handle file names with spaces, but there are certain things that either don’t work at all or require awkward workarounds when file names have spaces.\nYou will see a file in the Files pane with file extension .Rproj, but you should never touch that file. It’s just for RStudio to keep track of your project details.\nAny additional files you need for your project should be placed in this directory. In all future chapters, the first thing you will do is download the chapter file from the book website and place it here in your project folder. If you are using RStudio through a web browser, you’ll need to upload files to your project folder using the “Upload” button in the Files tab. If you have installed R and RStudio on your own machine, you’ll need to navigate your system to find the downloaded file and move or copy it to your project working directory. (It’s likely in a folder called “Downloads”. But if it’s not and you need to find it elsewhere, this is done most easily using File Explorer in Windows and the Finder in MacOS.)",

For example, in a markdown file, one can make headers by using number signs (or hashtags as the kids are calling them these days2). The Quarto file itself is just a plain text file. To see the formatting, the file has to be converted to HTML, which is the format used for web pages. (This process is described below.)\nQuarto documents are just text files that use markdown. They also allow you to include R code alongside the text. Here’s an example of a “code chunk”:\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nClick the little dark green, right-facing arrow in the upper-right corner of the code chunk. (The icon I’m referring to is next to a lighter green icon with a downward-facing arrow.) When you “run” the code chunk like this, R produces the appropriate output.

You can see some tricks that we won’t need much (embedding web links, making lists, etc.) and some tricks that we will use in every chapter (like R code chunks).\nAt first, you’ll want to work back and forth between the Quarto document and the HTML file to get used to how the formatting in the plain text file get translated to output in the HTML file. You can hit the Render button any time you want to update the HTML output with your most recent changes. After a while, you will look at the HTML file less often and work mostly in the Quarto file, only rendering the final HTML output occasionally, most importantly when you are finished and ready to produce your final draft.\nOne additional benefit of rendering often is that it also automatically saves your progress. If you choose to render less often, you’ll want to save your document manually from time to time just so you don’t lose any work in case of a computer malfunction.

If you are looking at the pretty HTML file, you’ll need to go back to RStudio.) The section at the very top of the file that starts and ends with three hyphens is called the YAML header.

Scroll up and do that now. Come back here when you’re done.\nYou’ve made changes to the document, so you’ll need to push the “Render” button again. Once that’s done, look at the resulting HTML document. The YAML header has been converted into a nicely formatted document header with the new information you’ve provided.\nNext, you’ll see three colons followed by the text {.callout-note}. Then there is some text that lists R functions that will be introduced in the chapter. (There aren’t any in this chapter, but there usually will be in future chapters.) Then there are three more colons. It’s very important that you do not modify the three colons or any of the text that appears on the same line in the the curly braces next to the colons! This will mess up your ability to Render the document.\nAnother place you will see the three-colon “tags” will be when providing answers to homework questions. It will start with three colons next to {.answer} and end with three colons. While you should be careful not to modify those tags, you can and should modify the plain text that lies between the colon tag fences. Let’s try it:\n\nReplace this text here with something else. (Anything you want to type here is fine.) Then render the document and see how it appears in the HTML file.\n\nTo be clear, the colorful answer boxes are not part of the standard Quarto tool set.

    "section": "2.9 R code chunks",
    "text": "2.9 R code chunks\nThe most powerful feature of Quarto is the ability to do data analysis right inside the document. This is accomplished by including R code chunks. An R code chunk doesn’t just show you the R code in your output file; it also runs that code and generates output that appears right below the code chunk.\nAn R code chunk starts with three “backticks” followed by the letter r enclosed in braces, and it ends with three more backticks. (The backtick is usually in the upper-left corner of your keyboard, next to the number 1 and sharing a key with the tilde ~.)\nIn RStudio, click the little dark green, right-facing arrow in the upper-right corner of the code chunk below, just as you did earlier.\n\n# Here's some sample R code\ntest &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\nsum(test)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nAfter pushing the dark green arrow, you should notice that the output of the R code appeared like magic. If you Render the HTML output, you should see the same output appear. If you hover your mouse over the dark green arrow, you should see the words “Run Current Chunk”. We’ll call this the Run button for short.\nWe need to address something here that always confuses people new to R and Quarto. A number sign (aka “hashtag”) in a Quarto document gives us section headers. In R code, however, a number sign indicates a “comment” line. In the R code above, the line # Here's some sample R code is not executed as R code. But you can clearly see that the two lines following were executed as R code. So be careful! Number signs inside and outside R code chunks behave very differently.\nTypically, the first code chunk that appears in our document will load any packages we need. We will be using a package called tidyverse (which is really a collection of lots of different packages) throughout the course. We load it now. Click on the Run button (the dark green, right-facing arrow) in the code chunk below. (If you get an error that says “there is no package called tidyverse” that means you failed to install it earlier. Go back and use install.packages as instructed at the top of this document.)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThe output here consists of a bunch of information generated when trying to load the package. These are not errors, even though one section is labeled “Conflicts”. Usually, errors appear with the word “Error”, so it’s typically clear when something just didn’t work. Also note that once you’ve loaded a package, you don’t need to load it again until you restart your R session. For example, if you go back and try to run the code chunk above one more time, the output will disappear. That’s because tidyverse is already loaded, so the second “run” doesn’t actually generate output anymore.\nOkay, let’s do something interesting now. We’ll revisit the penguins data set we introduced in the previous chapter. Remember, though, that this data set also lives in a package that needs to be loaded. Run the code chunk below to load the palmerpenguins package. (There may not be any output. But the command worked silently in the background to load the palmerpenguins package.)\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nLet’s see what happens when we try to run multiple commands in one code chunk:\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n\n  \n\n\ntail(penguins)\n\n\n  \n\n\nstr(penguins)\n\ntibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nIf you’re looking at this in RStudio, it’s a bit of a mess. RStudio did its best to give you what you asked for, but there are three separate commands here. The first two (head and tail) print some of the data, so the first two boxes of output are tables showing you the head and the tail of the data. The next one (str) normally just prints some information to the Console. So RStudio gave you an R Console box with the output of this command.\nIf you look at the HTML file, you can see the situation isn’t as bad. Each command and its corresponding output appear nicely separated there.\nNevertheless, it will be good practice and a good habit to get into to put multiple output-generating commands in their own R code chunks. Run the following code chunks and compare the output to the mess you saw above:\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\ntail(penguins)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nstr(penguins)\n\ntibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nThis won’t look any different in the HTML file, but it sure looks a lot cleaner in RStudio.\nWhat about the two lines of the first code chunk we ran above?\n\ntest &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\nsum(test)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nShould these two lines be separated into two code chunks? If you run it, you’ll see only one piece of output. That’s because the line test &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) works invisibly in the background. The vector test gets assigned, but no output is produced. Try it and see (push the Run button):\n\ntest &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nSo while there’s no harm in separating these lines and putting them in their own chunks, it’s not strictly necessary. You really only need to separate lines when they produce output. (And even then, if you forget, RStudio will kindly give you multiple boxes of output.)\nSuppose we define a new variable called test2 in a code chunk. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS EXERCISE, DO NOT HIT THE RUN BUTTON YET! But do go look at the HTML file.\n\ntest2 &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\ntest2\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n\nThe first line defines test2 invisibly. The second line asks R to print the value of test2, and the HTML document shows the vector of three letters printed in the output below the code chunk. DON’T HIT THE RUN BUTTON YET!\nOkay, now go to the Console in RStudio (in the lower left corner of the screen). Try typing test2. You should get an “Error: object ‘test2’ not found.”\nWhy does this happen? The Global Environment doesn’t know about it yet. Look in the upper right corner of the screen, under the “Environment” tab. You should see test, but not test2.\nOkay, NOW GO BACK AND CLICK THE RUN BUTTON IN THE LAST CHUNK ABOVE. The output appears in RStudio below the code chunk and the Global Environment has been updated.\nThe take home message is this:\nBe sure to run all your code chunks in RStudio!\nIn RStudio, look in the toolbar above this document, toward the right. You should see the word “Run” with a little drop-down menu next to it. Click on that drop-down menu and select “Run All”. Do you see what happened? All the code chunks ran again, and that means that anything in the Global Environment will now be updated to reflect the definitions made in the Quarto document.\nIt’s a good idea to “Run All” when you first open a new Quarto document. This will ensure that all your code chunks have their output below them (meaning you don’t have to go through and click the Run button manually for each chunk, one at a time) and the Global Environment will accurately reflect the variables you are using.\nYou can “Run All” from time to time, but it’s easier just to “Run All” once at the beginning, and then Run individual R code chunks manually as you create them.\nNow go back to the Environment tab and find the icon with the little broom on it. Click it. You will get a popup warning you that you about to “remove all objects from the environment”. Click “Yes”. Now the Global Environment is empty. Go back to the “Run” menu and select “Run All”. All the objects you defined in the Quarto document are back.\nClearing out your environment can be useful from time to time. Maybe you’ve been working on a chapter for a while and you’ve tried a bunch of stuff that didn’t work, or you went back and changed a bunch of code. Eventually, all that junk accumulates in your Global Environment and it can mess up your Quarto document. For example, let’s define a variable called my_variable.\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 42\n\nThen, let’s do some calculation with my_variable.\n\nmy_variable * 2\n\n[1] 84\n\n\nPerhaps later you decide you don’t really need my_variable. Put a hashtag in front of the code my_variable &lt;- 42 to comment it out so that it will no longer run, but don’t touch the next code chunk where you multiply it by 2. Now try running the code chunk with my_variable * 2 again. Note that my_variable is still sitting in your Global Environment, so you don’t get any error messages. R can still see and access my_variable.\nNow go to the “Run” menu and select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”. This clears the Global Environment and runs all the R code starting from the top of the Quarto document. This time you will get an error message: object 'my_variable' not found. You’ve tried to calculate with a variable called my_variable that doesn’t exist anymore. (The line in which it was defined has been commented out.)\nIt’s best to make sure all your code chunks will run when loaded from a clean R session. The “Restart R and Run All Chunks” option is an easy way to both clear your environment and re-run all code chunks. You can do this as often as you want, but you will definitely want to do this one last time when you are done. At the end of the chapter, when you are ready to prepare the final draft, please select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”. Make sure everything still works!\nTo get rid of the error above, uncomment the line my_variable &lt;- 42 by removing the hashtag you added earlier.",

One neat feature is the ability to use R to calculate things right in the middle of your text.\nHere’s an example. Suppose we wanted to compute the mean body mass (in grams) for the penguins in the penguins data set. We could do this:\n\nmean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4201.754\n\n\n(The na.rm = TRUE part is necessary because two of the penguins are missing body mass data. More on missing data in future chapters.)\nBut we can also do this inline by using backticks and putting the letter r inside the first backtick. Go to the HTML document to see how the following sentence appears:\nThe mean body mass for penguins in the penguins data set is 4201.754386 grams.\nYou can (and should) check to make sure your inline R code is working by checking the HTML output, but you don’t necessarily need to go to the HTML file to find out. In RStudio, click so that the cursor is somewhere in the middle of the inline code chunk in the paragraph above. (In other words, click on some part of the text in between the backticks.) Now hit Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter (PC or Mac respectively). A little box should pop up that shows you the answer!\nNotice that, in addition to the inline R command that calculated the mean, we also enclosed penguins in backticks to make it stand out in the output. We’ll continue to do that for all computer commands and R functions. But to be clear, putting a word in backticks is just a formatting trick. If you want inline R code, you also need the letter r followed by a space inside the backticks.",

    "text": "2.12 Copying and pasting\nIn future chapters, you will be shown how to run statistical analyses using R. Each chapter will give extensive explanations of the statistical concepts and demonstrations of the necessary R code. Afterwards, there will be one or more exercises that ask you to apply your new-found knowledge to run similar analyses on your own with different data.\nThe idea is that you should be able to copy and paste the R code from the previously worked examples. But you must be thoughtful about how you do this. The code cannot just be copied and pasted blindly. It must be modified so that it applies to the exercises with new data. This requires that you understand what the code is doing. You cannot effectively modify the code if you don’t know which parts to modify.\nThere will also be exercises in which you are asked to provide your own explanations and interpretations of your analyses. These should not be copied and pasted from any previous work. These exercises are designed to help you understand the statistical concepts, so they must be in your own words, using your own understanding.\nIn order to be successful in these chapters, you must do the following:\n\nRead every part of the chapter carefully!\n\n\nIt will be tempting to skim over the paragraphs quickly and just jump from code chunk to code chunk. This will be highly detrimental to your ability to gain the necessary understanding—not just to complete the chapter, but to succeed in statistics overall.\n\n\nCopy and paste thoughtfully!\n\n\nNot every piece of code from the early part of the chapter will necessarily apply to the later exercises. And the code that does apply will need to be modified (sometimes quite heavily) to be able to run new analyses. Your job is to understand how the code works so that you can make changes to it without breaking things. If you don’t understand a piece of code, don’t copy and paste it until you’ve read and re-read the earlier exposition that explains how the code works.\n\nOne final note about copying and pasting. Sometimes, people will try to copy and paste code from the HTML output file. This is a bad idea. The HTML document uses special characters to make the output look pretty, but these characters don’t actually work as plain text in a Quarto document. The same applies to things copied and pasted from a Word document or another website. If you need to copy and paste code, be sure to find the plain text Quarto file (the one with the .qmd extension here in RStudio) and copy and paste from that.",

    "text": "3.2 Categorical data\nData comes in different types depending on what is being measured. When people think of “data”, they often imagine numerical data, consisting of numbers. But there are other kinds of data as well.\nIn this chapter, we focus on categorical data that groups observations into categories.\nFor example, if we record the species of a penguin, that is not a number. It’s a word that classifies that penguin into one of a finite number of types. Whenever you see words in a data set, there’s a good chance that you’re looking at categorical data.\nEven “numbers” can sometimes represent categorical data. For example, suppose in a survey there is a Yes/No question. Instead of seeing the words “Yes” or “No”, though, you might see a data set with ones and zeros, where 1 = Yes and 0 = No. The presence of numbers does not automatically make that data numerical. In fact, the data is categorical. Yes and No are categories that sort the survey respondents into two groups based on their responses to a certain question.\nWhat about ZIP codes? They are recorded as numbers, and unlike the Yes/No example above, those numbers aren’t just substitutes for words. Nevertheless, ZIP codes are categorical. They sort addresses into a finite number of groups based on geographic proximity.\nAnother way to think of it is this: can the numerical values of ZIP codes be treated as numbers in any meaningful way? Can you take a sum or an average of ZIP codes? Sure, technically a computer can add up or average a set of ZIP codes, but would the result be a meaningful number? Since the answer is “no” we cannot think of ZIP codes as numbers, even though they are recorded that way.\n\nExercise 1\nThink of another type of data that would be recorded using numbers but should be thought of as categorical data.\n(Recall from the last chapter that you will record your answers to exercises within an answer block like the one below, demarcated with three colons at both ends.

    "text": "3.4 Summarizing one categorical variable\nIf you need to summarize a single categorical variable, a frequency table usually suffices. This is simply a table that counts up all the instances of each category. The word “frequency” is synonymous here with the word “count”.\nWe can use the table command:\n\ntable(penguins$species)\n\n\n   Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo \n      152        68       124 \n\n\nRecall that the dollar sign means to grab the variable species from the tibble penguins.\nYou can also generate a relative frequency table which is a table that uses proportions or percentages instead of counts.\nNOTE: For purposes of this course, we’re going to be very careful about the terms proportion and percentage. For us, a proportion will always be a number between 0 and 1 whereas a percentage will be between 0 and 100. Calculating a percentage is the same as multiplying a proportion by 100.\nThe table command stops being convenient if you want proportions instead of counts. Instead, we will use the tabyl command from the janitor package that was loaded near the top of the chapter. The syntax for this command is a little different. The tibble goes first, followed by a comma, followed by the variable you want to summarize:\n\ntabyl(penguins, species)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow you get both counts and proportions. Note that in the output above, it’s a little misleading to call the last column “percent”. These are actually proportions, and we would have to multiply by 100 to get percentages.\nIt’s usually nice to have the column totals. We can achieve that by using an adorn function to get them as follows:\n\ntabyl(penguins, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe’ll always include the totals at the bottom.\nIf you really want percentages, we can use a different adorn function:\n\ntabyl(penguins, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAgain, we’ll also include adorn_totals so that we get the column totals.\n\ntabyl(penguins, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe syntax above looks a little confusing with the unusual |&gt; symbols everywhere. You will learn more about that weird set of symbols in a later chapter. For now, you can just copy and paste this code and make any necessary changes to the tibble and/or variables names as needed.\n\nExercise 3(a)\nUse the tabyl command as above to create a frequency table for the sex of the penguins. Include the column totals at the bottom. (You will also get a relative frequency table for free.)\n\n\n# Add code here to create a frequency table for sex\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3(b)\nIn the table for sex that you just created, what does the row labeled &lt;NA&gt; mean?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 3(c)\nNow create a relative frequency table for sex that reports percentages and not proportions (still including the column totals at the bottom).\n\n\n# Add code here that reports percentages instead of proportions\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3(d)\nIn the previous tables, what is the difference between percent and valid_percent? Why are there two different sets of percentages being computed?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

    "section": "3.5 Graphing one categorical variable",
    "text": "3.5 Graphing one categorical variable\nWhen asked, “What type of graph should I use when graphing a single categorical variable?” the simple answer is “None.” If you do need to summarize a categorical variable, a frequency table usually suffices.\nIf you really, really want a graph, the standard type is a bar chart. But before we can create one, we need to start learning about the very important tool we will use throughout the course for graphing. It’s called ggplot and it’s part of a package called ggplot2.1\nWe don’t have to load the ggplot2 package explicitly because it got loaded alongside a number of other packages when we called library(tidyverse) early on in the chapter.\n\n3.5.1 ggplot\nThe ggplot command is an all-purpose graphing utility. It uses a graphing philosophy derived from a book called The Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson. The basic idea is that each variable you want to plot should correspond to some element or “aesthetic” component of the graph. The obvious places for data to go are along the y-axis or x-axis, but other aesthetics are important too; graphs often use color, shape, or size to illustrate different aspects of data. Once these aesthetics have been defined, we will add “layers” to the graph. These are objects like dots, boxes, lines, or bars that dictate the type of graph we want to see.\nIn an introductory course, we won’t get too fancy with these graphs. But be aware that there’s a whole field of data visualization that studies clear and interesting ways to understand data graphically.\nIt will be easier to explain the ggplot syntax in the context of specific graph types, so let’s create a bar chart for species.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll walk through this syntax step by step.\n\nThe first argument of the ggplot command is the name of the tibble, in this case, penguins.\nNext we define the aesthetics using aes and parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we assign any variables we want to plot to aesthetics of the graph. For this analysis, we are only interested in the variable species and for a bar chart, the categorical variable typically goes on the x-axis. That’s why it says x = species inside the aes argument.\nFinally, ggplot needs to know what kind of graph we want. Graph types are called “geoms” in the ggplot world, and geom_bar() tells ggplot to add a “bar chart layer”. Adding a layer is accomplished by literally typing a plus sign.\n\nThis can be modified somewhat to give proportions (relative frequencies) on the y-axis instead of counts. Unfortunately, the ggplot syntax is not very transparent here. My recommendation is to copy and paste the code below if you need to make a relative frequency bar chart in the future, making the necessary changes to the tibble and variable names, of course.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese bar charts are the graphical analogues of a frequency table and a relative frequency table, respectively.\n\nExercise 4\nIn a sentence or two at most, describe the distribution of species in this data set.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nWhat about pie charts? Just. Don’t.\nSeriously. Pie charts suck: https://medium.com/the-mission/to-pie-charts-3b1f57bcb34a\nOkay, in fairness, here is the opinion of one data visualization researcher who gives a (somewhat qualified) defense of pie charts (in certain narrow situations): https://eagereyes.org/pie-charts\nWe will not be creating any pie charts in this course.",

    "section": "3.6 Summarizing two categorical variables",
    "text": "3.6 Summarizing two categorical variables\nA table summarizing two categorical variables is called a contingency table (or pivot table, or cross-tabulation, or probably several other terms as well).\nFor example, we might pose the following question: is the distribution of sex among penguins in our data more or less balanced across the three species?\nWhen we work with two variables, typically we think of one variable as response and the other as predictor. The response variable is usually the variable of main interest. A predictor variable is another attribute that might predict or explain more about the response variable. Often, the predictor variable is used to divide our data into groups for comparison.\nFor example, our question is concerned with the sex distribution of penguins. We could create a relative frequency table of sex alone to see if male and female penguins are balanced in the data. In fact, you did that very thing above and saw that, indeed, there were roughly equal numbers of male and female penguins. But is that still true when we divide up the data into the three groups representing the separate species?\nTwo variables are called associated when there is a relationship between them. For example, if sex and species were associated, then the distribution of sex would change depending on the species. Maybe one species of penguin had more females and another had fewer females available to the researchers who compiled this data. Our prediction of the sex distribution would change based on the value of the predictor (grouping) variable species.\nOn the other hand, two variables that are not associated are called independent. Independent variables are not related. If the sex distribution were the same across all species, then knowledge of the species would not change our predictions about the sex of a penguin. It wouldn’t matter because there was no relationship between sex and species.\nMost research questions that involve two or more variables are fundamentally questions of whether a response variable is associated with one or more predictor variables, or whether they are independent.\nLet’s look at a contingency table. The tabyl command will place the first variable listed across the rows and the second one listed down the columns. Since we always include column totals, we want the predictor variable to be the column variable so we can see how the predictor groups are distributed in the data. Always list the response variable first.\n\ntabyl(penguins, sex, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nEach column is a group, and our question is whether the distribution of sexes in each column is similar.\nThe last row of totals is called the marginal distribution (because it sits in the “margin” of the contingency table). It is equivalent to a frequency table for species.\n\nExercise 5\nCounts can be misleading. For example, there are 73 female Adelie penguins, but only 34 female Chinstrap penguins. Does that mean that Adelie penguins are more likely to be female than Chinstrap penguins? Why or why not?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nA more fair way to compare across columns is to create relative frequencies. We can do this with a slightly different adorn command. The following code says that we want to compute column proportions (yes, I know the command is called adorn_percentages, but these are proportions):\n\ntabyl(penguins, sex, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt’s important to put “col” inside the adorn_percentages command. Look what happens if we forget:\n\n# We should not do this!\ntabyl(penguins, sex, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat are these proportions? The next code chunk will reveal the secret:\n\n# We should not do this!\ntabyl(penguins, sex, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"row\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe default for adorn_percentages is to create row proportions. But these are not helpful to us. We are not grouping by sex and then trying to figure out the distribution of species within each sex. It’s the opposite of our research question.\nIf we actually want percentages instead of proportions, we need one more line of code. This command—adorn_pct_formatting—is the same as we used before with frequency tables.\n\ntabyl(penguins, sex, species) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow we can see that each column adds up to 100%. In other words, each species is now on equal footing, and only the distribution of sexes within each group matters.\n\n\nExercise 6(a)\nWhat percentage of Adelie penguins are male? What percentage of Chinstrap penguins are male? What percentage of Gentoo penguins are male?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 6(b)\nDoes sex appear to be associated with species for the penguins in this data set? Or are these variables independent? Why?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe islands of Antarctica on which the penguins were observed and measured are recorded in the variable called island. Is the distribution of the three species of penguin the same (or similar) on the three islands?\n\n\nExercise 7(a)\nChoosing which variables play the roles of response and predictor can be tricky. For the question above, with species and island, which is response and which is predictor?\nOne way to think about this is to ask the following two questions and see which one is closer to the question asked:\n\nGiven information about the species, are you interested in which island the penguin lives on? If so, species is a predictor and island is response. (You are using species to predict island.)\nGiven information about the island, are you interested in the species of the penguin? If so, island is a predictor and species is response. (You are using island to predict species.)\n\nAnother way to think of this is to determine the grouping variable. Which variable is being used to divide the penguins into groups first? That will be the predictor variable.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 7(b)\nCreate a contingency table with percentages. List species first, followed by island.

    "section": "3.7 Graphing two categorical variables",
    "text": "3.7 Graphing two categorical variables\nA somewhat effective way to display two categorical variables is with a side-by-side bar chart. Here is the ggplot code for the relationship between sex and species.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(fill = sex, x = species)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is somewhat different from the first ggplot example you saw above, so let’s take a moment to go through it.\n\nThe first argument is the data frame penguins; no mystery there.\nThe second aesthetic x = species also makes a lot of sense. As species is our predictor variable—we’re using species to group the penguins, and then within each species, we’re interested in the sex distribution—species goes on the x-axis.\nHowever, sex does not go on the y-axis! (This is a very common mistake for novices.) The y-axis of a bar chart is always a count or a proportion/percentage, so no variable should ever go on the y-axis of a bar chart. In that case, how does sex enter the picture? Through the use of color! The aesthetic fill = sex says to use the sex variable to shade or “fill” the bars with different colors. You’ll also notice that ggplot makes a legend automatically with the colors so you can see which color corresponds to which value (in this case, “female”, “male”, or “NA” for the missing data).\n\nAnother unusual feature is the argument position = \"dodge\" in the geom_bar layer. Let’s see what happens if we remove it.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(fill = sex, x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a stacked bar chart! This is another popular way of displaying two categorical variables, but we don’t tend to prefer it. Notice how difficult it is to compare the number of females across species; since there is no common baseline for the red segments of each bar, it is harder to determine which ones are bigger or smaller. (In this case, it’s fairly clear, but there are plenty of data sets for which the counts might be a lot closer.)\nSo let’s agree to use side-by-side bar charts. There is still one aspect of the side-by-side bar chart that is misleading, though. For example, the red bar for Adelie penguins is bigger than the red bar for Gentoo penguins. Does this mean Adelie penguins are more likely to be female?\nThis is the same issue we identified in an exercise above. To fix this problem, a better option here would be to use relative frequencies (i.e., proportions/percentages within each group) instead of counts on the y-axis. This is analogous to using proportions/percentages in a contingency table. Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to do this with ggplot. A compromise is available: by using position = fill, you can create a stacked bar chart that scales every group to 100%. Making comparisons across groups can still be hard, as explained above for any kind of stacked bar chart, but it works okay if there are only two categories in the response variable (as is almost the case with sex here, although the missing data distorts things a little at the bottom).\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(fill = sex, x = species)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph does correctly show that the sexes are pretty much equally balanced across all three species.\n\nExercise 8(a)\nUsing species and island, create a side-by-side bar chart. Be careful, though, to change the sample code above to make sure species is now the response variable (using the fill aesthetic) and that island is the explanatory variable (using x). (Hey, that’s another hint to go back and look at the previous exercise and make sure you got part (a) right!)\n\n\n# Add code here to make a side-by-side bar chart.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8(b)\nComment on the association or independence of the two variables.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

Let’s look at the year variable:\n\nglimpse(penguins$year)\n\n int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\nThese appear as integers.

For example, ggplot often fails to do the right thing when a categorical variable is coded as a number. Therefore, we need a way to change numerically coded variables to factors.\nThe code below uses a command called mutate that takes an old variable and creates a new variable. (You’ll learn more about this command in a later chapter. For now, you can just copy and paste this code if you need it again.) The name of the new variable can be anything we want; we’ll just call it year_fct. Then the real work is being done by the as_factor command that converts the numeric year variable into a factor variable.\nObserve the effect below:\n\npenguins &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  mutate(year_fct = as_factor(year))\nglimpse(penguins)\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 9\n$ species           &lt;fct&gt; Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n$ year_fct          &lt;fct&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10(a)\nMake a contingency table of the species measured in each year using counts. Use the species variable first, followed by the new factor variable year_fct. (Think about why that order makes sense. We will always list the response variable first so that the categories of interest will be the rows and the groups will be the columns.)\n\n\n# Add code here to make a contingency table for species and year with counts.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10(b)\nMake a contingency table of the species measured in each year using column percentages (not proportions).

    "text": "3.9 Plotting summary data\nEverything we did above was summarizing raw data; that is, the data consisted of all the observations for each individual penguin. Often, though, when you find data out in the wild, that data will be summarized into a table already and you may not have access to the raw data.\nFor example, let’s suppose that you found some data online, but it looked like this:\n\n\n\nspecies\ncount\n\n\n\n\nAdelie\n152\n\n\nChinstrap\n68\n\n\nGentoo\n124\n\n\n\nThis raises two questions:\n\nHow would you get this data into R?\nHow would you plot the data?\n\nTo answer the first question, we show you how to create your own tibble. Here is the syntax:\n\npenguin_species_table &lt;- tibble(\n  species = c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"),\n  count = c(152, 68, 124)\n)\npenguin_species_table\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBasically, the tibble command creates a new tibble. Then each column of data must be entered manually as a “vector” using the c to group all the data values together for each column. Be careful about the placement of quotation marks, commas, and parentheses.\nOnce we have our summary data, we want to make a bar chart. But this won’t work:\n\nggplot(penguin_species_table, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12\nExplain what went wrong with the previous command? Why does ggplot think that each species has count 1? (Hint: in tibble you just created, look at the species column. What if R thinks this is raw data where each row represents a single penguin?)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nInstead, we need to use geom_col. This works a lot like geom_bar except that it also requires a y value in its aesthetics to force the command to look for the counts in some other variable in the data.\n\nggplot(penguin_species_table, aes(x = species, y = count)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 13(a)\nUse the tabyl command to create a frequency table for island.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a frequency table for island\n\n\n\n\nExercise 13(b)\nUse the tibble command to create a new tibble manually that contains the frequency data for the island variable. It should have two columns, one called island and the other called count. Name it penguin_island_table.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a tibble with frequency data for island\n\n\n\n\nExercise 13(c)\nUse ggplot with geom_col to create a bar chart for island.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a bar chart for island",

    "text": "3.10 Recovering raw data from tables\n\n3.10.1 Recovering raw data from a frequency table\nSometimes we come across summary data instead of raw data. We’ve learned how to manually create tibbles with that summary data and use geom_col instead of geom_bar to graph it, but sometimes it is also useful to recover what the raw data would have been. Fortunately there are R tools to do exactly that.\nWe’ll continue with our example penguin_species_table, reprinted here for reference:\n\npenguin_species_table\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFrom this table, we know what the raw data for this variable should look like: there should be 152 rows that say “Adelie,” 68 rows that say “Chinstrap,” and 124 rows that say “Gentoo.” It would be very annoying, though, to make that whole tibble by hand.\nThe hero of the day is the function uncount from the tidyr package (loaded automatically when you loaded the tidyverse package):\n\npenguin_species_raw &lt;- penguin_species_table |&gt;\n  uncount(count)\npenguin_species_raw\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nClick through the rows of this table and you’ll see that it’s exactly what we wanted: “Adelie” is repeated 152 times, “Chinstrap” is repeated 68 times, and “Gentoo” is repeated 124 times. Neat!\n\n\n3.10.2 Recovering raw data from a contingency table\nThis strategy also works, with some modifications, for recovering the raw data presented in a contingency table. Previously, we saw the following contingency table showing the counts of each species broken down by sex:\n\n\n\nsex\nAdelie\nChinstrap\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\nfemale\n73\n34\n58\n\n\nmale\n73\n34\n61\n\n\n\n(Note: we’ve removed the unruly penguins who did not allow their sex to be determined.)\nAgain, we can imagine what the raw data would look like: there would be 73 rows where the species variable would say “Adelie” and the sex variable would say “female,” then 34 rows where the species variable would say “Chinstrap” and the sex variable would say “female,” and so on.\nWe can start by building a tibble with this information in the same way we built the tibble of penguin species counts. Note that the species labels now become the column headers.\n\npenguin_species_sex_table &lt;- tibble(\n  sex = c(\"female\", \"male\"),\n  Adelie = c(73, 73),\n  Chinstrap = c(34, 34),\n  Gentoo = c(58, 61)\n)\npenguin_species_sex_table\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn order for the uncount function to work correctly, we need to have all the counts in a single column, but since this is a contingency table, our counts are spread out across several columns. To solve this problem, we’ll need to “pivot” the columns, turning them into rows. The command is called pivot_longer. (There is also a pivot_wider command that turns rows into columns, but we won’t need that one.)\n\npenguin_species_sex_table |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf we want a little more control over the names of the newly created columns, we can add those as follows:\n\npenguin_species_sex_table |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"),\n               names_to = \"species\",\n               values_to = \"count\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow our data is in a form that uncount can handle. And indeed, we can assemble all these steps together into a pipeline. First, we should build the tibble, then pivot the tibble, and finally uncount to get back to the raw data. We want store the result as a new tibble.\nHere are all the steps put together:\n\n# This is the summary data in contingency table form,\n# stored as a tibble\npenguin_species_sex_table &lt;- tibble(\n  sex = c(\"female\", \"male\"),\n  Adelie = c(73, 73),\n  Chinstrap = c(34, 34),\n  Gentoo = c(58, 61)\n)\n\n# This is the pipeline that starts with the contingency table\n# and produces the raw data, one penguin per row\npenguin_species_sex_table |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"),\n               names_to = \"species\",\n               values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  uncount(count) -&gt; penguin_species_sex_raw\n\npenguin_species_sex_raw\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIndeed, this new tibble looks just like how we wanted it to look.\n(Notice the clever use of the arrow -&gt; in the last line of the pipeline. We are used to assigning variables with &lt;- and the name of the new variable on the left. But we can also use `-&gt; at the end of the line with the name of the new variable on the right!)",

This is often a requirement for publishing in print journals. If we use gray (spelled “grey” in ggplot code) for the bars, it would also be best to turn off the gray background using a “theme” (called theme_bw).\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(fill = sex, x = species)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Sex of penguins by species\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       x = \"Species\",\n       fill = \"Sex\") +\n  scale_fill_grey() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some reason, the default color for missing values is red, which is somewhat annoying.

    "text": "3.12 Conclusion\nYou can summarize a single categorical variable using a frequency table. For only one categorical variable, a graph is usually overkill, but if you really want a graph, the bar chart is the best option. Both raw counts and proportions/percentages can be useful.\nWe use contingency tables to summarize two categorical variables. Unless groups are of equal size, raw counts can be incredibly misleading here. You should include proportions/percentages to be able to compare the distributions across groups. If the proportions/percentages are roughly the same, the variables are more likely to be independent, whereas if the proportions/percentages are different, there may be an association between the variables.\nFor graphing two categorical variables, the best choice is usually a side-by-side bar chart. A stacked bar chart will also work, especially if using relative frequencies on the y-axis, but it can be hard to compare across groups when the response variable has three or more categories.\nSometimes we come across categorical data that is recorded using numbers. Many R commands will not work properly if they expect factors and receive numbers, so we use the mutate command to create a new variable along with as_factor to convert the numbers to categories.\nSometimes we come across summary data instead of raw data. We can then manually create tibbles with that summary data and use geom_col instead of geom_bar to graph it. We can even reproduce the raw data by using the uncount command on tables.\nFinally, there are various modifications we can make to ggplot code to make our graphs more professional, clear, and friendly for those experiencing colorblindness.\n\n3.12.1 Preparing and submitting your assignment\n\nFrom the “Run” menu, select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”.\nDeal with any code errors that crop up.

    "text": "4.3 Statistics\nThe word “statistics” has several meanings. On one hand, it’s an entire field of study, as in the subject of this course. More specifically, though, a “statistic” is any kind of numerical summary of data. While there are many ways to summarize numerical data, they mostly fall into two main flavors: measures of center and measures of spread. Measures of center try to estimate some kind of average, middle, or common value in data. Measures of spread try to estimate something like the width, range, variability, or uncertainty of data.\nThere are two pairs of measurements that we will learn about in this chapter: the mean/standard deviation, and the median/IQR.\n\n4.3.1 Mean and standard deviation\nThe first pair of the summary statistics we’ll discuss consists of the mean and the standard deviation.\nThe mean of a variable \\(y\\)—denoted \\(\\bar{y}\\) and pronounced “y bar”—is calculated by summing all the values of the variable, and dividing by the total number of observations. In formula form, this is\n\\[\n\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum y}{n}.\n\\]\nThis is a measure of center since it estimates the “middle” of a set of numbers. It is calculated in R using the mean command.\nThroughout this chapter, we will be using the penguins data set. (If you need a reminder, look at the help file for penguins using one of the methods discussed in Chapter 2.)\nIf we want to calculate the mean body mass of our penguins (in grams), we type the following:\n\nmean(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nUnfortunately, this didn’t give us an answer. As you may recall from previous chapters, this is because we are missing data. There are several values of body mass missing in this data. We need an extra piece of code to tell R to ignore that missing data and give us the mean of the valid data.\n\nmean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4201.754\n\n\n(The term na.rm stands for “NA remove”.)\nWe never leave such numbers without interpretation. In a full, contextually meaningful sentence, we might say, “The mean body mass of this group of penguins is approximately 4200 grams.”\nNotice that we mentioned the penguins, placing this number in context, and we mentioned the units of measurement, grams. (Otherwise, what would this number mean? 4200 pounds? Okay, probably not, but you should always mention the units of measurement.) Also notice that we rounded the final value. A gram is a very small unit of measurement, so there is no need to report this value to many decimal places.\nIf we use inline code, we can say, “The mean body mass of this group of penguins is 4201.754386 grams.” There are ways of rounding this number as well, but it’s a bit of a hassle to do so in inline code.\nThe corresponding measure of spread is the standard deviation. Usually this is called \\(s\\) and is calculated using a much more complicated formula:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (y - \\bar{y})^2}{n - 1}}.\n\\]\nThis is a measure of spread because the \\((y - \\bar{y})\\) term measures how far away each data point is from the mean.\nIn R, this is calculated with the sd command. Again, we’ll need to add na.rm = TRUE.\n\nsd(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 801.9545\n\n\n“The standard deviation of this group of penguins is about 800 grams.”\nOr using inline code:\n“The standard deviation of this group of penguins is 801.9545357 grams.”\nThe mean and the standard deviation should always be reported together. One without the other is incomplete and potentially misleading.\nAnother related measurement is the variance, but this is nothing more than the standard deviation squared:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum (y - \\bar{y})^2}{n - 1}.\n\\]\n(Compare this formula to the one for the standard deviation. Nothing has changed except for the removal of the square root.) We rarely use the variance in an introductory stats class because it’s not as interpretable as the standard deviation. The main reason for this is units. If the data units are grams, then both the mean and the standard deviation are also reported in grams. The variance has units of “grams squared”, but what does that even mean? If you need to calculate the variance in R, the command is var.\n\nvar(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 643131.1\n\n\nYou can check and see that the number above really is just 801.9545357 squared. Regarding the inline code in the previous sentence, remember, in the Quarto document, you can click inside the inline code and hit Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter. In the HTML document, the number will be calculated and will magically appear.\n\n\n4.3.2 Median and IQR\nAnother choice for measuring the center and spread of a data set is the median and the IQR.\nThe median is just the middle value if the list of values is ordered. In R, it is calculated using the median command.\n\nmedian(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4050\n\n\nThe median body mass of these penguins is 4050 grams.\nThe median value depends on whether the number of data points is an even or odd number. If it’s odd, there is a middle value in the list. Convince yourself this is true; for example, look at the numbers 1 through 7.\n\n1:7\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nThe number 4 is in the middle of the list, with three numbers to either side.\nHowever, if there are an even number of data points, there is no number right in the middle:\n\n1:8\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\nThe “midpoint” of this list would lie between 4 and 5 with four values to either side of this line. If this is the case, we calculate the median by taking the mean of the two numbers straddling the middle. In the case of 1 though 8 above, the median would be 4.5.\nA nice shortcut “trick” for figuring out where the middle value should be is to use the formula \\((n + 1)/2\\) where n is the number of data points:\n\\[\n\\frac{n + 1}{2}\n\\]\nAs before, if n = 7, then the formula says\n\\[\n\\frac{7 + 1}{2} = 4\n\\]\nThe median is the 4th value in the list.\nIf n = 8,\nthen the formula says\n\\[\n\\frac{8 + 1}{2} = 4.5\n\\]\nThe middle of the list of numbers is between the 4th and 5th entries. The median will be the average of those two numbers.\nLet’s print out the entire body_mass_g variable, all 342 valid values (not including the missing values, of course). If we’re clever about it, we can see them in order using the sort command.\n\nsort(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\n  [1] 2700 2850 2850 2900 2900 2900 2900 2925 2975 3000 3000 3050 3050 3050 3050\n [16] 3075 3100 3150 3150 3150 3150 3175 3175 3200 3200 3200 3200 3200 3250 3250\n [31] 3250 3250 3250 3275 3300 3300 3300 3300 3300 3300 3325 3325 3325 3325 3325\n [46] 3350 3350 3350 3350 3350 3400 3400 3400 3400 3400 3400 3400 3400 3425 3425\n [61] 3450 3450 3450 3450 3450 3450 3450 3450 3475 3475 3475 3500 3500 3500 3500\n [76] 3500 3500 3500 3525 3525 3550 3550 3550 3550 3550 3550 3550 3550 3550 3575\n [91] 3600 3600 3600 3600 3600 3600 3600 3625 3650 3650 3650 3650 3650 3650 3675\n[106] 3675 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3700 3725 3725 3725\n[121] 3750 3750 3750 3750 3750 3775 3775 3775 3775 3800 3800 3800 3800 3800 3800\n[136] 3800 3800 3800 3800 3800 3800 3825 3850 3875 3900 3900 3900 3900 3900 3900\n[151] 3900 3900 3900 3900 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3950 3975\n[166] 4000 4000 4000 4000 4000 4050 4050 4050 4050 4050 4050 4075 4100 4100 4100\n[181] 4100 4100 4150 4150 4150 4150 4150 4150 4200 4200 4200 4200 4200 4250 4250\n[196] 4250 4250 4250 4275 4300 4300 4300 4300 4300 4300 4300 4300 4350 4350 4375\n[211] 4400 4400 4400 4400 4400 4400 4400 4400 4450 4450 4450 4450 4450 4475 4500\n[226] 4500 4500 4550 4550 4575 4600 4600 4600 4600 4600 4625 4625 4650 4650 4650\n[241] 4650 4650 4675 4700 4700 4700 4700 4700 4700 4725 4725 4725 4750 4750 4750\n[256] 4750 4750 4775 4800 4800 4800 4850 4850 4850 4850 4875 4875 4875 4900 4900\n[271] 4925 4925 4950 4950 4975 5000 5000 5000 5000 5000 5000 5050 5050 5050 5100\n[286] 5100 5100 5150 5150 5200 5200 5200 5200 5250 5250 5250 5300 5300 5300 5300\n[301] 5350 5350 5350 5400 5400 5400 5400 5400 5450 5500 5500 5500 5500 5500 5550\n[316] 5550 5550 5550 5550 5550 5600 5600 5650 5650 5650 5700 5700 5700 5700 5700\n[331] 5750 5800 5800 5850 5850 5850 5950 5950 6000 6000 6050 6300\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nIf there are 342 penguins in this data set with body mass data, between which two values in the list above would the median lie? In other words, between what two positions in the list will be median be found? Show your work using the \\((n + 1)/2\\) trick.\nVerify that the median you find from this list is the same as the one we calculated with the median command above.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nCalculating the interquartile range—or IQR—requires first the calculation of the first and third quartiles, denoted Q1 and Q3. If the median is the 50% mark in the sorted data, the first and third quartiles are the 25% and the 75% marks, respectively. One way to compute these by hand is to calculate the median of the lower and upper halves of the data separately. Then again, it’s hard to know how to split the data set into halves if there are an odd number of observations. There are many different methods for computing percentiles in general, but you don’t need to worry too much about the particular implementation in R. One you have Q1 and Q3, the IQR is just\n\\[\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n\\]\nIn R, you can get the IQR by using—are you ready for this?—the IQR command.\n\nIQR(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1200\n\n\nThe IQR for this group of penguins is 1200 grams.\nThe IQR is a measure of spread because the distance between Q1 and Q3 measures the span of the “middle 50%” of the data.\nA general function for computing any percentile in R is the quantile function. For example, since Q1 is the 25th percentile, you can compute it as follows:\n\nQ1 &lt;- quantile(penguins$body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nQ1\n\n 25% \n3550 \n\n\nThe 25% label is cute, but somewhat unnecessary, and it will mess up a later command, so let’s get rid of it:\n\nQ1 &lt;- unname(Q1)\nQ1\n\n[1] 3550\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2(a)\nNow you compute Q3. (Hint: what number will go in the quantile function instead of 0.25?)\n\n\n# Add code here to compute, store, and print out Q3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2(b)\nReassign Q3 using the unname command as we did above to strip the unnecessary label.\n\n\n# Add code here that uses the unname command \n\n\n\n\nExercise 2(c)\nSubtract Q3 minus Q1 in R. (Literally, the code is just Q3 - Q1.)\nVerify that the output below matches the value of the IQR we calculated earlier.\n\n\n# Add code here to compute Q3 - Q1.\n\n\n\nThe median and the IQR should always be reported together.\nAlso, don’t mix and match. For example, it doesn’t really make sense to report the mean and the IQR. Nor should you report the median and the standard deviation. They go together in pairs: either the mean and the standard deviation together, or the median and the IQR together.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Robust statistics\nSome statistics are more sensitive than others to features of the data. For example, outliers are data points that are far away from the bulk of the data. The mean and especially the standard deviation can change a lot when outliers are present. Also, skewness in the data frequently pulls the mean too far in the direction of the skew while simultaneously inflating the standard deviation. (We’ll learn more about skewed data later in this chapter.)\nOn the other hand, the median and IQR are “robust”, meaning that they do not change much (or at all) in the presence of outliers and they tend to be good summaries even for skewed data.\n\nExercise 3\nExplain why the median and IQR are robust. In other words, why does an outlier have little or no influence on the median and IQR?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Five-number summary\nA five-number summary is the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum of a set of numbers.\nThe summary command in R gives you the five-number summary, and throws in the mean for good measure. (Note that it does not require na.rm = TRUE!)\n\nsummary(penguins$body_mass_g)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n   2700    3550    4050    4202    4750    6300       2 \n\n\nYou can, of course, isolate the various pieces of this. You already know most of the commands below. (These individual commands all do require na.rm = TRUE.)\n\nmin(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2700\n\n\n\nmedian(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4050\n\n\n\nmax(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 6300\n\n\nRemember the quantile function from earlier, where we computed Q1? We’re going to use it in a new way. This is what we did before:\nquantile(penguins$body_mass_g, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\nWhat about this instead?\n\nquantile(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n2700 3550 4050 4750 6300 \n\n\n\nExercise 4\nWhat is the small difference between the way quantile was used in a previous exercise versus the way it is used here? How did that change the output?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nAlso, don’t forget about the trick for using R commands inline. If you need to mention a statistic in the middle of a sentence, there is no need to break the sentence and display a code chunk. Be sure you’re looking at the Quarto document (not the HTML file) to note that the numbers in the next sentence are not manually entered, but are calculated on the fly:\nThere are 344 penguins in this data set and their median body mass is 4050 grams.\n\n\nExercise 5\nType a full, contextually meaningful sentence using inline R code (as above, but changing the commands) reporting the minimum and maximum body mass (in grams) in our data set.\nRemember that inline code requires a backtick immediately followed by the letter r and then a space. Then you can type your R code. The code must be followed by another backtick. You will need two pieces of inline code in your answer to report both the minimum and maximum in context.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

    "text": "4.4 Graphing one numerical variable\nFrom the penguins data, let’s consider again the body mass in grams. This is clearly a numerical variable.\nThe single most useful display of a single numerical variable is a histogram. Here is the ggplot command to do that:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way histograms work is to create “bins”, which are ranges of numbers along the x-axis. R goes through the data and counts how many observations fall into each bin. In that way, a histogram is somewhat like a bar chart. However, a bar chart uses bars to represent distinct, discrete categories, whereas a histogram uses bars that are all next to each other to represent values along a continuous numerical range. Histograms are meant to give you–at a quick glance–a sense of the “shape” of the data.\n\n4.4.1 The shape of data\nWhat do we mean by “shape”? Generally, we look for three things:\n\nModes\n\n\nModes are peaks in the data. These are places where data tends to cluster, representing common values of the numerical variable. In the penguin data, there appears to be a big mode between about 3500 and 4000 grams. When data has one clear mode, we call the data unimodal. But data can also be bimodal, or more generally, multimodal. This often happens when the data contains multiple groups that are different from each other. In this case, we know there are three species of penguin in the data, so if those species are drastically different in their body mass, we might be looking at multimodal data. We’ll explore this question more later in the chapter. For now, it’s hard to say what’s going on because the above histogram has a lot of spiky bars popping up all over. It’s not completely obvious how many modes there might be.\n\n\nSymmetry\n\n\nIf there is one mode, we can also ask if the data is spread evenly to the left and right of that mode. If so, we call the data symmetric. No data is perfectly symmetric, but we are looking for overall balance between the areas to the left and right of the mode. When data is not symmetric, we call it skewed. Assuming that there is one big mode around 3500 or 4000, the body mass data above is skewed. There is clearly more data to the right of the mode than to the left. The right side of the histogram stretches out further than the left relative to the mode. Therefore, the body mass data is right-skewed. There is a longer “tail” to the right. If it were the opposite, it would be left-skewed. It is common for beginning students to confuse these two terms. Be aware that we are not concerned about where the mode is. We want to know which side has more data spread into a longer tail. That is the direction of the skewness.\n\n\nOutliers.\n\n\nOutliers are data points that are far from the bulk of the data. The body mass data above appears to have no outliers. We are looking for a large gap between the main “mass” of data and any lingering data points far away from that mass. There is no such large gap in the histogram above.\n\nWhenever you are asked about the “shape” of a numerical variable, be sure to comment on (1) modes, (2) symmetry, and (3) outliers.\nGenerally, the default binning for ggplot histograms is not great. This is by design. The creator of the ggplot2 package, Hadley Wickham, said the following:\n\n“In ggplot2, a very simple heuristic is used for the default number of bins: it uses 30, regardless of the data. This is perverse, and ignores all of the research on selecting good bin sizes automatically, but sends a clear message to the user that he or she needs to think about, and experiment with, the bin width. This message is reinforced with a warning that reminds the user to manually adjust the bin width.”\n\nIndeed, if you look at the output from the graphing command above, you can see that ggplot informs you that you should pick a better value for the binwidth. You can also see that the bins aren’t ideal. They are too narrow, which means that arbitrary differences between bins show up as “random” spikes all over the graph. These spikes can confuse the issue of how many modes appear in the data.\nInstead, we should aim to use bins that show the overall shape of the data and smooth it out a bit. Look back at the scale of the x-axis to assess how wide each bar should be. There’s no one correct answer. In this case, the bins ought to be a little wider. Since our x-axis goes from about 2500 to 6500, maybe we should try a binwidth of 250. And if 250 doesn’t look good, nothing prevents us from trying a different number.\nIt’s also easier to interpret the histogram when the bins’ edges line up with numbers that are easy to see in the plot. Use boundary to determine where you want the bin boundaries to fall. For example, if we set the boundary to 3500, that means that one bar will start with its left edge at 3500. This is convenient because there is a tick mark labeled there on the x-axis. The boundary number is pretty arbitrary; once one boundary is set, it determines where all the other bins will line up. With a binwidth of 250, we’d get the same graph if the boundary were set to 3000 or 3250 or 5750, or even 0. Any other multiple of 250 would give the same graph.\nWe use binwidth and boundary inside the parentheses of the geom_histogram to modify these parameters.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with the smoother look, it appears that there are multiple modes, maybe three? Do these correspond to the three species of penguin? Stay tuned.\n(Note that we are still seeing a warning, but this warning is about missing data. We can’t do anything about that, so we can safely ignore this warning.)\n\nExercise 6(a)\nHere is a histogram of the penguin bill lengths (measured in millimeters):\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 6, boundary = 30)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a short paragraph describing the shape of the distribution of penguin bill lengths, focusing on the three key shape features (modes, symmetry, and outliers).\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 6(b)\nThe last question was a trick question!\nChange the binwidth (no need to change the boundary) to something smaller to see more clearly the bimodal nature of the distribution.\n\n\n# Add code here that changes the binwidth of the last histogram to see\n# the bimodal nature of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7(a)\nMake a histogram of the variable flipper_length_mm. Start with a histogram where you don’t modify the binwidth or boundary. (In other words, use geom_histogram() with nothing inside the parentheses.)\n\n\n# Add code here to create a histogram of flipper length\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7(b)\nBy examining the scale on the x-axis above, repeat the command, but this time change the binwidth until you are satisfied that the bins are neither too wide nor too narrow. (You can set the boundary too, but your choice of boundary is not super important.)\n\n\n# Add code here to modify the histogram of flipper length,\n# adding binwidth and boundary\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7(c)\nWrite a short paragraph describing the shape of the distribution of penguin flipper lengths, focusing on the three key shape features (modes, symmetry, and outliers).\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Less useful plot types\nThere are several other graph types that one might see for a single numerical variable: e.g., dotplots, stem-and-leaf plots, boxplots, etc. We’re not big fans of dotplots or stem-and-leaf plots as they are just messier versions of histograms. We do like boxplots, but they are typically less informative than histograms. Boxplots are much better for comparing groups, and we’ll see them later in the chapter.",

    "text": "4.5 Graphing two numerical variables\nThe proper graph for two numerical variables is a scatterplot. We graph the response variable on the y-axis and the predictor variable on the x-axis.2\nLet’s consider a possible association between bill length and body mass. For this question, there is not really a strong preference for which variable serves as response and which variable servers as predictor. We’ll consider bill length as the response variable and body mass as the predictor.\nSince we are plotting two variables, we have two aesthetics, one on the y-axis (the response variable) and one on the x-axis (the predictor variable). Since scatterplots use points to plot each data value, the correct layer to add is geom_point().\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for evidence of a relationship between the two variables. This will manifest as a pattern in the data. We are interested in answering the following questions:\n\nLinearity\n\n\nIs the association linear? In other words, do the data points lie roughly in a straight line pattern? The scatterplot above is a bit “cloudy” but generally moves from lower left to upper right in a straight (not curved pattern). It’s not a completely random scatter of dots.\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nIf the pattern is linear, it is a positive relationship or a negative one? Positive means that the line moves from lower left to upper right. Negative means it moves from upper left to lower right. If you recall the direction of slopes from high school algebra class, a positive association corresponds to a line with a positive slope, and similarly for a negative association. In the data above, lower values of body mass correspond to lower bill lengths, and higher values of body mass correspond to higher bill lengths. So this is a positive association.\n\n\nStrength\n\n\nIf there is a pattern, how tight is the pattern? Do the data points stay close to a straight line, or are they pretty spread out and only generally moving in one direction. A strong relationship is one that is tightly packed around a line or curve. The relationship above is not strong. We might use terms like “weak”, “moderately weak”, or “moderate”, but definitely not strong.\n\n\nOutliers\n\n\nAre there outliers? These will be points that are isolated and relatively far from the bulk of the data. There are a few points above that are borderline, but none is a particularly strong outlier, especially given how spread out the rest of the data is.\n\n\nExercise 8\nHere is a scatterplot of flipper lengths against body mass:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a short paragraph describing the association of penguin flipper lengths and body mass, focusing on the four key features (linearity, direction, strength, and outliers).\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

Usually, the idea here is that the categorical variable divides up the data into groups and you are interested in understanding the numerical variable for each group separately. Another way to say this is that your numerical variable is response and your categorical variable is predictor. (It is also possible for a categorical variable to be response and a numerical variable to be predictor. This is common in so-called “classification” problems. We will not cover this possibility in this course, but it is covered in more advanced courses.)\nThis turns out to be exactly what we need in the penguins data. Throughout the above exercises, there was a concern that the penguin measurements are fundamentally different among the three different species of penguin.\nGraphically, there are two good options here. The first is a side-by-side boxplot.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = body_mass_g, x = species)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the placement of the variables. The y-axis is body_mass_g, the numerical variable. The x-axis variable is species; the groups are placed along the x-axis. This is consistent with other graph types that place the response variable on the y-axis and the predictor variable on the x-axis.\nThe other possible graph is a stacked histogram. This uses a feature called “faceting” that creates a different plot for each group. The new ggplot command is called facet_grid. The only slightly unusual syntax you need to know is that the predictor variable has to be inside vars() as in the following code chunk:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(species))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, the default bins suck, so let’s change them.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(species))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we specified rows in the facet_grid function. What if we had specified columns instead?\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500) +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(species))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nExplain why that last graph (which might be called a side-by-side histogram) is less effective than the earlier stacked histogram. (Hint: which variable can you line up with your eyes when the histograms are stacked vertically rather than horizontally?)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe other thing that kind of sucks is the fact that the y-axis is showing counts. That makes it harder to see the distribution of body mass among Chinstrap penguins, for example, as there are fewer of them in the data set. It would be nice to scale these using percentages.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),\n                 binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(species))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to some technical issues in ggplot2, these are not strictly proportions. (If you were to add up the heights of all the bars, they would not add up to 100%.) Nevertheless, the graph is still useful because it does scale the groups to put them on equal footing. In other words, it treats each group as if they all had the same sample size.\n\n\nExercise 10\nChoose a numerical variable that’s not body mass and a categorical variable that’s not species from the penguins data set. Make both a side-by-side boxplot and a stacked histogram. Discuss the resulting graphs. Comment on the association (or independence) of the two variables.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a side-by-side boxplot.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a stacked histogram.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

    "text": "4.7 Publication-ready graphics\nThe great thing about ggplot2 graphics is that they are already quite pretty. To take them from exploratory data analysis to the next level, there are a few things we can do to tidy them up.\nLet’s go back to the first histogram from this chapter.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable names of this data set are already pretty informative, but we can do a little better with labs (for labels). Observe:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of body mass for adult foraging penguins near\n       Palmer Station, Antarctica\",\n       x = \"Body mass (grams)\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see that we took the opportunity to mention the units of measurement (grams) for our variable in the x-axis label. This is good practice.\nA quick note about formatting in R code chunks. Notice that we often put different parts of the commands on their own separate lines. The last ggplot command would still work if we did this:\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, boundary = 3500) + labs(title = \"Distribution of body mass for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica\", x = \"Body mass (in grams)\", y = \"Count\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s much harder to read. If you find that your code is “wrapping” to the next line, find some spots like commas or plus signs to break the code. Be sure to break the line after the comma or plus sign.\n\nExercise 11\nModify the following scatterplot by adding a title and labels for both the y-axis and x-axis. (Don’t forget to include units of measurement on both axes!)\n\n\n# Modify the following scatterplot by adding a title and \n# labels for both the y-axis and x-axis.\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12\nThe previous scatterplot looks a little funny due to some odd groupings that we suspect (as usual) might be due to multiple species being measured. Let’s use color to investigate! Once we decide to involve color, we’ll need to add a Viridis color palette to make it colorblind-friendly. This time, though, the command is scale_color_viridis_d instead of scale_fill_viridis_d. In ggplot, the “color” aesthetic is used for points in a scatterplot, as opposed to “fill” for bars in a bar chart. We’ll also use a more simple black-and-white background theme. We’ve already added the necessary code below for you.\nYour task is to make the color appear. Add a new aesthetic (so, inside the parentheses following aes) to the following code to assign color = species.\nBelow the graph, comment on what you see.\n\n\n# Modify the aesthetics to add color = species\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  theme_bw()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\nAnother way to include a grouping variable is to use shape instead of color.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm,\n                     shape = species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defaults here leave a lot to be desired. It’s hard to see clusters in the data when all the shapes (circle, triangle, and square) look like similar little blobs.\nWith some advanced customization, we can get a slightly more visually distinct choice of shapes, but it may not be worth the extra work unless you are forced to print in black-and-white (say, as required by a print publication).\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm,\n                     shape = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(2, 3, 20))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis website has a nice description of all the available shapes and how to use them: https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/point-shape-options-in-ggplot/\nEvery part of the graph can be customized, from the color scheme to the tick marks on the axes, to the major and minor grid lines that appear on the background. We won’t go into all that, but you can look at the ggplot2 documentation online and search Google for examples if you want to dig in and figure out how to do some of that stuff. However, the default options are often (but not always) the best, so be careful that your messing around doesn’t inadvertently make the graph less clear or less appealing.",

Measures of center tell us where the “middle” of our numerical data lies, and measures of spread tell us how spread out our numerical data is. These measures should always be reported in pairs, for example the mean/standard deviation, or the median/IQR.\nThe ggplot2 package with its ggplot command is a very versatile tool for creating nice graphs relatively easily. For a single numerical variable, the standard graph type is a histogram. For two numerical variables, use a scatterplot. For a numerical response with a categorical predictor, use either a side-by-side boxplot or a stacked histogram.\n\n4.8.1 Preparing and submitting your assignment\n\nFrom the “Run” menu, select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”.\nDeal with any code errors that crop up.

But it is useful to see how to get a data set from outside the R ecosystem. This depends a lot on the format of the data file, but a common format is a “comma-separated values” file, or CSV file. If you have a data set that is not formatted as a CSV file, it is usually pretty easy to open it in something like Google Spreadsheets or Microsoft Excel and then re-save it as a CSV file.\nThe file we’ll import is a random sample from all the commercial domestic flights that departed from Houston, Texas, in 2011.\nWe use the read_csv command to import a CSV file. In this case, we’re grabbing the file from a web page where the file is hosted. If you have a file on your computer, you can also put the file into your project directory and import it from there. Put the URL (for a web page) or the filename (for a file in your project directory) in quotes inside the read_csvcommand.

    "text": "5.3 Introduction to dplyr\nThe dplyr package (pronounced “dee-ply-er”) contains tools for manipulating the rows and columns of tibbles. The key to using dplyr is to familiarize yourself with the “key verbs”:\n\nselect (and rename)\nfilter (and slice)\narrange\nmutate (and transmute)\nsummarise (with group_by)\ncount\n\nWe’ll consider these one by one. We won’t have time to cover every aspect of these functions.

    "section": "5.4 select",
    "text": "5.4 select\nThe select verb is very easy. It just selects some subset of variables (the columns of your data set).\nThe select command from the dplyr package illustrates one of the common issues R users face. Because the word “select” is pretty common, and selecting things is a common task, there are multiple packages that have a function called select. Depending on the order in which packages were loaded, R might get confused as to which version of select you want and try to apply the wrong one. One way to get the correct version is to specify the package in the syntax. Instead of typing select, we can type dplyr::select to ensure we get the version from the dplyr package. We’ll do this in all future uses of the select function. (The other functions in this chapter don’t cause us trouble because we don’t use any other packages whose functions conflict like this.)\nSuppose all we wanted to see was the carrier, origin, and destination. The command to do this appears in the next code chunk. (Note that we’re only going to print the first 100 rows. It takes a lot of memory to keep printing tibbles that have 22,758 rows!)\n\nhf_select &lt;- dplyr::select(hf, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest)\nhead(hf_select, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nA brief but important aside here: there is nothing special about the variable name hf_select. We could have typed\nbeef_gravy &lt;- dplyr::select(hf, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest)\nand it would work just as well. Generally speaking, though, you want to give variables a name that reflects the intent of your analysis.\nAlso, it is important to assign the result to a variable. If we had just typed\ndplyr::select(hf, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest)\nthe result would print to the screen, but it wouldn’t be stored anywhere for future use.\nAlso, it is important to assign the result to a new variable. If we had typed\nhf &lt;- dplyr::select(hf, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest)\nthis would have overwritten the original tibble hf with this new version with only three variables. We want to preserve hf because we want to do other things with the entire data set later.\nThe take-home message here is this: Major modifications to your data should generally be given a new variable name. There are caveats here, though. Every time you create a new tibble, you also fill up more memory with your creation. So if you don’t need the old version of a tibble anymore, you are safe to overwrite the old version with something new and continue working with that newer modification.\nOkay, back to the select function. The first argument of select is the tibble. After that, just list all the names of the variables you want to select.\nIf you don’t like the names of the variables, you can change them as part of the select process. For example,\n\nhf_select &lt;- dplyr::select(hf,\n                           carrier = UniqueCarrier,\n                           origin = Origin,\n                           dest = Dest)\nhead(hf_select, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n(Note here that we are overwriting hf_select which had been defined slightly differently before. However, these two versions of hf_select are basically the same object, so no need to keep the older version around just taking up space unnecessarily.)\nThere are a few notational shortcuts. For example, try to figure out what the following commands are doing:\n\nhf_select2 &lt;- dplyr::select(hf, DayOfWeek:UniqueCarrier)\nhead(hf_select2, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nhf_select3 &lt;- dplyr::select(hf, starts_with(\"Taxi\"))\nhead(hf_select3, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nWhat is contained in the new tibbles hf_select2 and hf_select3? In other words, what does the colon (:) appear to do and what does starts_with appear to do in the select function?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe cheat sheet shows a lot more of these “helper functions” if you’re interested.\nThe other command that’s related to select is rename. The only difference is that select will throw away any columns you don’t select (which is what you want and expect, typically), whereas rename will keep all the columns, but rename those you designate.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPutting a minus sign in front of a variable name in the select command will remove the variable. Create a tibble called hf_select4 that removes Year, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, FlightNum, and Diverted. (Be careful with the unusual—and inconsistent!—capitalization in those variable names.) In the second part of the code chunk below, type head(hf_select4, n = 100) so that the first 100 rows of the tibble print to the screen (just like in all the above examples).\n\n\n# Add code here to define hf_select4.\n# Add code here to print the first 100 rows of hf_select4.\n\n\n\nTo free up some memory, we’re going to remove some of the tibbles we’ve created. This won’t affect how they will print out above. You will never have to do this on your own.\n\nrm(hf_select, hf_select2, hf_select3)",

(We can print all the rows here because the resulting tibble is much smaller!)\n\nhf_filter &lt;- filter(hf, UniqueCarrier == \"DL\")\nhf_filter\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the printout of the tibble above, if you can’t see the UniqueCarrier column, click the black arrow on the right to scroll through the columns until you can see it. You can click “Next” at the bottom to scroll through the rows.\n\nExercise 4\nHow many rows did we get in the hf_filter tibble? What do you notice about the UniqueCarrier of all those rows?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nJust like select, the first argument of filter is the name of the tibble. Following that, you must specify some condition. Only rows meeting that condition will be included in the output.\nOne thing that is unusual here is the double equal sign (UniqueCarrier == \"DL\"). This won’t be a mystery to people with programming experience, but it tends to be a sticking point for the rest of us. A single equals sign represents assignment. If I type x = 3, what I mean is, “Take the letter x and assign it the value 3.” In R, we would also write x &lt;- 3 to mean the same thing. The first line of the code chunk below assigns x to be 3. Therefore, the following line that just says x creates the output “3”.\n\nx = 3\nx\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOn the other hand, x == 3 means something completely different. This is a logical statement that is either true or false. Either x is 3, in which case we get TRUE or x is not 3, and we get FALSE.\n\nx == 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n(It’s true because we just assigned x to be 3 in the previous code chunk!)\nIn the above filter command, we are saying, “Give us the rows where the value of UniqueCarrier is \"DL\", or, in other words, where the statement UniqueCarrier == \"DL\" is true.\nAs another example, suppose we wanted to find out all flights that leave before 6:00 a.m. Due to the interesting way that times are stored in this data, we can do something like the following:\n\nhf_filter2 &lt;- filter(hf, DepTime &lt; 600)\nhf_filter2\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nLook at the help file for hflights again (linked in Exercise 1). Why do we have to use the number 600 in the command above? (Read the description of the DepTime variable.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nIf we need two or more conditions, we use & for “and” and | for “or”. The following will give us only the Delta flights that departed before 6:00 a.m.\n\nhf_filter3 &lt;- filter(hf, UniqueCarrier == \"DL\" & DepTime &lt; 600)\nhf_filter3\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAgain, check the cheat sheet for more complicated condition-checking if needed.\n\n\nExercise 6(a)\nThe symbol != means “not equal to” in R. Use the filter command to create a tibble called hf_filter4 that finds all flights except those flying into Salt Lake City (“SLC”). As before, print the first 100 rows to the screen.\n\n\n# Add code here to define hf_filter4.\n# Add code here to print the first 100 rows of hf_filter4.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6(b)\nHow many flights were there flying into SLC? In other words, how many rows were removed from the original hf tibble to produce hf_filter4?\nBe careful! You only printed 100 rows to the screen, but that doesn’t represent all the filtered data. How can you figure out how many rows are actually left in hf_filter4?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe slice command is related, but fairly useless in practice. It will allow you to extract rows by position. So slice(hf, 1:10) will give you the first 10 rows. As a general rule, the information available in a tibble should never depend on the order in which the rows appear. Therefore, no function you run should make any assumptions about the ordering of your data. The only reason one might want to think about the order of data is for convenience in presenting that data visually for someone to inspect. And that brings us to…",

    "text": "5.7 mutate\nFrequently, we want to create new variables that combine information from one or more existing variables. We use mutate for this. For example, suppose we wanted to find the total time of the flight. We might do this by adding up the minutes from several variables: TaxiOut, AirTime, and TaxiIn, and assigning that sum to a new variable called total. Scroll all the way to the right in the output below (using the black right arrow) to see the new total variable.\n\nhf_mutate &lt;- mutate(hf, total = TaxiOut + AirTime + TaxiIn)\nhead(hf_mutate, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs it turns out, that was wasted effort because that variable already exists in ActualElapsedTime. The all.equal command below checks that both specified columns contain the exact same values.\n\nall.equal(hf_mutate$total, hf$ActualElapsedTime)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nPerhaps we want a variable that just classifies a flight as arriving late or not. Scroll all the way to the right in the output below to see the new late variable.\n\nhf_mutate2 &lt;- mutate(hf, late = (ArrDelay &gt; 0))\nhead(hf_mutate2, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis one is a little tricky. Keep in mind that ArrDelay &gt; 0 is a logical condition that is either true or false, so that truth value is what is recorded in the late variable. If the arrival delay is a positive number of minutes, the flight is considered “late”, and if the arrival delay is zero or negative, it’s not late.\nIf we would rather see more descriptive words than TRUE or FALSE, we have to do something even more tricky. Look at the late variable in the output below.\n\nhf_mutate3 &lt;- mutate(hf,\n                     late = as_factor(ifelse(ArrDelay &gt; 0, \n                                             \"Late\", \"On time\")))\nhead(hf_mutate3, n = 100)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe as_factor command tells R that late should be a categorical variable. Without it, the variable would be a “character” variable, meaning a list of character strings. It won’t matter for us here, but in any future analysis, you want categorical data to be treated as such by R.\nThe main focus here is on the ifelse construction. The ifelse function takes a condition as its first argument. If the condition is true, it returns the value in the second slot, and if it’s false (the “else” part of if/else), it returns the value in the third slot. In other words, if ArrDelay &gt; 0, this means the flight is late, so the new late variable should say “Late”; whereas, if ArrDelay is not greater than zero (so either zero or possibly negative if the flight arrived early), then the new variable should say “On Time”.\nHaving said that, I would generally recommend that you leave these kinds of variables as logical types. It’s much easier to summarize such variables in R, namely because R treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, allowing us to do things like this:\n\nmean(hf_mutate2$late, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.4761522\n\n\nThis gives us the proportion of late flights.\nNote that we needed na.rm as you’ve seen in previous chapter. For example, look at the 93rd row of the tibble:\n\nslice(hf_mutate2, 93)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNotice that all the times are missing. There are a bunch of rows like this. Since there is not always an arrival delay listed, the ArrDelay variable doesn’t always have a value, and if ArrDelay is NA, the late variable will be too. So if we try to calculate the mean with just the mean command, this happens:\n\nmean(hf_mutate2$late)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nWhy does taking the mean of a bunch of zeros and ones give us the proportion of ones? (Think about the formula for the mean. What happens when we take the sum of all the zeros and ones, and what happens when we divide by the total?)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 11\nCreate a new tibble called hf_mutate4 that uses the mutate command to create a new variable called dist_k which measures the flight distance in kilometers instead of miles. (Hint: to get from miles to kilometers, multiply the distance by 1.60934.) Print the first 100 rows of the output to the screen.\n\n\n# Add code here to define hf_mutate4.\n# Add code here to print the first 100 rows of hf_mutate4.\n\n\n\nA related verb is transmute. The only difference between mutate and transmute is that mutate creates the new column(s) and keeps all the old ones too, whereas transmute will throw away all the columns except the newly created ones. This is not something that you generally want to do, but there are exceptions. For example, if we were preparing a report and we needed only to talk about flights being late or not, it would do no harm (and would save some memory) to throw away everything except the late variable.\n\nTo free up some memory, we’re going to remove some of the tibbles we’ve created. This won’t affect how they will print out above. You will never have to do this on your own.\n\nrm(hf_mutate, hf_mutate2, hf_mutate3)",

We’ve seen this weird combination of symbols in past chapters, but we haven’t really explained what they do.\nPiping always looks more complicated than it really is. The technical definition is that\nx |&gt; f(y)\nis equivalent to\nf(x, y).\nAs a simple example, we could add two numbers like this:\n\nsum(2, 3)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOr using the pipe, we could do it like this:\n\n2 |&gt; sum(3)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nAll this is really saying is that the pipe takes the thing on its left, and plugs it into the first slot of the function on its right. So why do we care?\nLet’s revisit the combination group_by/summarise example above. There are two ways to do this without pipes, and both are a little ugly. One way is above, where you have to keep reassigning the output to new variables (in the case above, to hf_summ_grouped and then hf_summ). The other way is to nest the functions:\n\nsummarise(group_by(hf, UniqueCarrier), mean_dist = mean(Distance))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis requires a lot of brain power to parse. In part, this is because the function is inside-out: first you group hf by UniqueCarrier, and then the result of that is summarized. Here’s how the pipe fixes it:\n\nhf |&gt;\n  group_by(UniqueCarrier) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_dist = mean(Distance))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLook at the group_by line. The group_by function would normally take two arguments: the tibble, and then the grouping variable. But it appears to have only one argument. Now look at the previous line. The pipe says to insert whatever is on its left (hf) into the first slot of the function on its right (group_by). So the net effect is still to evaluate the function group_by(hf, UniqueCarrier).\nNow look at the summarise line. Again, summarise is a function of two inputs, but all we see is the part that finds the mean. The pipe at the end of the previous line tells the summarise function to insert the stuff already computed (the grouped tibble returned by group_by(hf, UniqueCarrier)) into the first slot of the summarise function.\nPiping takes a little getting used to, but once you’re good at it, you’ll never go back. It’s just makes more sense semantically. When we read the above set of commands, we see a set of instructions in chronological order:\n\nStart with the tibble hf.\nNext, group by the carrier.\nNext, summarize each group using the mean distance.\n\nNow we can assign the result of all that to the new variable hf_summ:\n\nhf_summ &lt;- hf |&gt;\n  group_by(UniqueCarrier) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_dist = mean(Distance))\nhf_summ\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSome people even take this one step further. The result of all the above is assigned to a new variable hf_summ that currently appears as the first command (hf_summ &lt;- ...) But you could write this as\n\nhf |&gt;\n  group_by(UniqueCarrier) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_dist = mean(Distance)) -&gt; hf_summ\n\nNow it says the following:\n\nStart with the tibble hf.\nNext, group by the carrier.\nNext, summarize each group using the mean distance.\nFinally, assign the result to a new variable called hf_summ.\n\n(As we’ve seen in a previous chapter, the arrow operator for assignment works both directions!)",

This is most easily accomplished using a more complicated sequence of pipes.\nHere’s an example of multi-step piping. Let’s say that we only care about Delta flights, and even then, we only want to know about the month of the flight and the departure delay. From there, we wish to group by month so we can find the maximum departure delay by month. Here is a solution, piping hot and ready to go. [groan]\n\nhf_grand_finale &lt;- hf |&gt;\n  filter(UniqueCarrier == \"DL\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(Month, DepDelay) |&gt;\n  group_by(Month) |&gt;\n  summarise(max_delay = max(DepDelay, na.rm = TRUE))\nhf_grand_finale\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nGo through each line of code carefully and translate it into English:\n\nWe define a variable called hf_grand_finale that starts with the original hf data.\nWe filter this data so that only Delta flights will be analyzed.\nWe select the variables Month and DepDelay, throwing away all other variables that are not of interest to us. (Don’t forget to use the dplyr::select syntax to make sure we get the right function!)\nWe group_by month so that the results will be displayed by month.\nWe summarise each month by listing the maximum value of DepDelay that appears within each month.\nWe print the result to the screen.\n\nNotice in the summarise line, we again took advantage of dplyr’s ability to rename any variable along the way, assigning our computation to the new variable max_delay. Also note the need for na.rm = TRUE so that the max command ignores any missing values.\nA minor simplification results from the realization that summarise must throw away any variables it doesn’t need. (Think about why for a second: what would summarise do with, say, ArrTime if we’ve only asked it to calculate the maximum value of DepDelay for each month?) So you could write this instead, removing the select clause:\n\nhf_grand_finale &lt;- hf |&gt;\n  filter(UniqueCarrier == \"DL\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Month) |&gt;\n  summarise(max_delay = max(DepDelay, na.rm = TRUE))\nhf_grand_finale\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCheck that you get the same result. With massive data sets, it’s possible that the selection and sequence of these verbs matter, but you don’t see an appreciable difference here, even with 22758 rows. (There are ways of benchmarking performance in R, but that is a more advanced topic.)\n\nExercise 13\nSummarize in your own words what information is contained in the hf_grand_finale tibble. In other words, what are the numbers in the max_delay column telling us? Be specific!\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\nThe remaining exercises are probably the most challenging you’ve seen so far in the course. Take each slowly. Read the instructions carefully. Go back through the chapter and identify which “verb” needs to be used for each part of the task. Examine the sample code in those sections carefully to make sure you get the syntax right. Create a sequence of “pipes” to do each task, one-by-one. Copy and paste pieces of code from earlier and make minor changes to adapt the code to the given task.\n\n\nExercise 14\nCreate a tibble named hf_ex14 that counts the flights to LAX grouped by day of the week.

    "text": "6.2 Redlining in Chicago\nThe data set we will use throughout this chapter is from Chicago in the 1970s studying the practice of “redlining”.\n\nExercise 1\nDo an internet search for “redlining”.\nConsult at least two or three sources. Then, in your own words (not copied and pasted from any of the websites you consulted), explain what “redlining” means.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe chredlin data set appears in the faraway package accompanying a book by Julian Faraway (Practical Regression and Anova using R, 2002.) Faraway explains:\n\n“In a study of insurance availability in Chicago, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights attempted to examine charges by several community organizations that insurance companies were redlining their neighborhoods, i.e. canceling policies or refusing to insure or renew. First the Illinois Department of Insurance provided the number of cancellations, non-renewals, new policies, and renewals of homeowners and residential fire insurance policies by ZIP code for the months of December 1977 through February 1978. The companies that provided this information account for more than 70% of the homeowners insurance policies written in the City of Chicago. The department also supplied the number of FAIR plan policies written and renewed in Chicago by zip code for the months of December 1977 through May 1978. Since most FAIR plan policyholders secure such coverage only after they have been rejected by the voluntary market, rather than as a result of a preference for that type of insurance, the distribution of FAIR plan policies is another measure of insurance availability in the voluntary market.”\n\nIn other words, the degree to which residents obtained FAIR policies can be seen as an indirect measure of redlining. This participation in an “involuntary” market is thought to be largely driven by rejection of coverage under more traditional insurance plans.\n\n\n6.2.1 Exploratory data analysis\nBefore we learn about correlation, let’s get to know our data a little better.\nType ?chredlin at the Console to read the help file.

    "text": "6.3 Correlation\nThe word correlation describes a linear relationship between two numerical variables. As long as certain conditions are met, we can calculate a statistic called the correlation coefficient, often denoted with a lowercase r.\nThere are several different ways to compute a statistic that measures correlation. The most common way, and the way we will learn in this chapter, is often attributed to an English mathematician named Karl Pearson. According to his Wikipedia page,\n\n“Pearson was also a proponent of social Darwinism, eugenics and scientific racism.”\n\n\nExercise 6\nDo an internet search for each of the following terms:\n\nSocial Darwinism\nEugenics\nScientific racism\n\nConsult at least two or three sources for each term. Then, in your own words (not copied and pasted from any of the websites you consulted), explain each of these terms.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nWhile Pearson is often credited with its discovery, the so-called “Pearson correlation coefficient” was first developed by a French scientist, Auguste Bravais. Due to the misattribution of discovery, along with the desire to disassociate the useful tool of correlation from its problematic applications to racism and eugenics, we will just refer to it as the correlation coefficient (without a name attached).\nThe correlation coefficient, r, has some important properties.\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1.\nA value close to 0 indicates little or no correlation.\nA value close to 1 indicates strong positive correlation.\nA value close to -1 indicates strong negative correlation.\n\nIn between 0 and 1 (or -1), we often use words like weak, moderately weak, moderate, and moderately strong. There are no exact cutoffs for when such words apply. You must learn from experience how to judge scatterplots and r values to make such determinations.\nA correlation is positive when low values of one variable are associated with low values of the other value. Similarly, high values of one variable are associated with high values of the other. For example, exercise is positively correlated with burning calories. Low exercise levels will burn a few calories; high exercise levels burn more calories, on average.\nA correlation is negative when low values of one variable are associated with high values of the other value, and vice versa. For example, tooth brushing is negatively correlated with cavities. Less tooth brushing may result in more cavities; more tooth brushing is associated with fewer cavities, on average.",

However, in statistics, we reserve the word “correlation” for situations meeting more stringent conditions:\n\nThe two variables must be numerical.1\nThere is a somewhat linear relationship between the variables, as shown in a scatterplot.\nThere are no serious outliers.\n\nFor condition (2) above, keep in mind that real data in scatterplots very rarely lines up in a perfect straight line. Instead, you will see a “cloud” of dots. All we want to know is whether that cloud of dots mostly moves from one corner of the scatterplot to the other. Violations of this condition will usually be for one of two reasons:\n\nThe dots are scattered completely randomly with no discernible pattern.\nThe dots have a pattern or shape to them, but that shape is curved and not linear.\n\n\nExercise 7\nCheck the three conditions for the relationship between involact and race.

    "text": "6.6 Correlation is not causation\nWhen two variables are correlated—indeed, associated in any way, not just in a linear relationship—that means that there is a relationship between them. However, that does not mean that one variable causes the other variable.\nFor example, we discovered above that there was a moderate correlation between the racial composition of a ZIP code and the new FAIR policies created in those ZIP codes. However, being part of a racial minority does not cause someone to seek out alternative forms of insurance, at least not directly. In this case, the racial composition of certain neighborhoods, through racist policies, affected the availability of certain forms of insurance for residents in those neighborhoods. And that, in turn, caused residents to seek other forms of insurance.\nIn the Chicago example, there is still likely a causal connection between one variable (race) and the other (involact), but it is indirect. In other cases, there is no causal connection at all. Here are a few of my favorite examples.\n\nExercise 10\nIce cream sales are positively correlated with drowning deaths. Does eating ice cream cause you to drown? (Perhaps the myth about swimming within one hour of eating is really true!) Do drowning deaths cause ice cream sales to rise? (Perhaps people are so sad about all the drownings that they have to go out for ice cream to cheer themselves up?)\nSee if you can figure out the real reason why ice cream sales are positively correlated with drowning deaths.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nIn the Chicago example, the causal effect was indirect. In the example from the exercise above, there is no causation whatsoever between the two variables. Instead, the causal effect was generated by a third factor that caused both ice cream sales to go up, and also happened to cause drowning deaths to go up. (Or, equivalently stated, it caused ice cream sales to be low during certain times of the year and also caused the drowning deaths to be low as well.) Such a factor is called a lurking variable. When a correlation between two variables exists due solely to the intervention of a lurking variable, that correlation is called a spurious correlation. The correlation is real; a scatterplot of ice cream sales and drowning deaths would show a positive relationship. But the reasons for that correlation to exist have nothing to do with any kind of direct causal link between the two.\nHere’s another one:\n\n\nExercise 11\nMost studies involving children create a number of weird correlations. For example, the height of children is very strongly correlated to pretty much everything you can measure about scholastic aptitude. For example, vocabulary count (the number of words children can use fluently in a sentence) is strongly correlated to height. Are tall people just smarter than short people?\nThe answer is, of course, no. The correlation is spurious. So what’s the lurking variable?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

    "section": "6.7 Observational studies versus experiments",
    "text": "6.7 Observational studies versus experiments\nSo when is a statistical finding (like correlation, for example) evidence of a causal relationship? Before we can answer that question, we need a few more definitions.\nA lot of data comes from “observational studies” where we simply observe or measure things as they are “in the wild,” so to speak. We don’t interfere in any way. We just write down what we see. Polls are usually observational in that we ask people questions and record their responses. We do not try to manipulate their responses in any way. We just ask the questions and observe the answers. Field studies are often observational. We go out in nature and write stuff down as we observe it.\nAnother way to gather data is an experiment. In an experiment, we introduce a manipulation or treatment to try to ascertain its effect. For example. if we’re testing a new drug, we will likely give the drug to one group of patients and a placebo to the other.\n\nExercise 12\nHere’s another internet rabbit hole for you. First, look up the definition of placebo. You do not need to write up your own version of that definition here; just familiarize yourself with the term if you’re not already familiar with it. Next, find some websites about the placebo effect and read those.\nGiven what you have learned about the placebo effect, why is it important to have a placebo group in a drug trial? Why not just give one set of patients the drug and compare them to another group that takes no pill at all?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe goal of the experiment is to learn whether the treatment (in this example, the drug) is effective when compared to the control (in this example, the placebo).\nNote that the word “effective” implies a causal claim. We want to know if the drug causes patients to get better.\nUnlike an observational study, in which the relationship between variables can be caused by a lurking variable, in an experiment, we purposefully manipulate one of the variables and try to control all others. For example, we manipulate the drug variable (we purposefully give some people the drug and others the placebo). But we control the amount of the drug given and the schedule on which patients are required to take the pills.\nThere are lots of things we cannot control. For example, it would be very difficult to control the diet of every person in the experiment. Could diet play a role in whether a patient gets better? Sure, so how do we know diet is not a lurking variable? In the context of an experiment, lurking variables are often called confounders or confounding variables.\nOne way to mitigate the effect of confounders that we cannot directly control is to randomize the patients into the treatment and control groups. With random selection, there will likely be people who have relatively healthy diets in both the control and treatment groups. If the drugs work, in theory they should still work better for the treatment group than for those taking the placebo. And likewise, patients with less healthy diets will generally be mixed up in both groups, and the drug should also work better for them.\nThe mantra of experimental design is, “Control as much as you can. Randomize to take care of the rest.”\nThere are lots of aspects of experimental design that we will not go into here (for example, blinding and blocking). But we will continue to mention the differences between observational studies and experiments in future chapters as we exercise caution in making causal claims.",

Why or why not?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nSo even when there is no direct causal link between two variables, if they are positively correlated, then large values of one variable are associated with large values of the other variable. So if I tell you one value is large, it is reasonable to predict that the other value will be large as well.\nWe use the language “predictor” variable and “response” variable to reinforce this idea.\nIn a properly designed and controlled experiment, we can use different language. In this case, we can explain the outcome using the treatment variable. If we’ve controlled for everything else, the only possible explanation for a difference between the treatment and control groups must be the treatment variable. If the patients get better on the drug (more so than those on the placebo) and we’ve controlled for every other possible confounding variable, the only possible explanation is that the drug works. The drug “explains” the difference in the response variable.\nBe careful, as sometimes statisticians use the term “explanatory variable” to mean any kind of variable that predicts or explains. In this course, we will try to use the term “predictor variable” exclusively.",

Is there a way to see lurking variables in the scatterplot as well?\nOne simple case is when the lurking variable is a categorical variable. We saw several examples of that in Chapters 3 and 4 in the penguins data. The association (or lack thereof) between variables was often misleading when we failed to take into account the fact that there were three different species of penguin.\nHere are a few more interesting examples.

Having said that, if you focus on the females separately, you can still see a strong positive correlation, and if you focus on males separately, there is also a strong positive correlation there. So the inclusion of sex didn’t really change much about the nature of the correlation in this example. Even still, the correlation coefficients do change a little depending on whether we look at the whole data set versus females/males separately:\n\ncor(bdims$sho_gi, bdims$che_gi)\n\n[1] 0.9271923\n\n\n\nbdims |&gt;\n  group_by(sex_fct) |&gt;\n  summarise(corr = cor(sho_gi, che_gi))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 14\nWhy would the correlation coefficient be stronger for the whole data set and slightly less strong for the sexes separately?

In other words, how did ignoring/considering sex alter the way we perceived the correlation between biacromial diameter and weight?

    "text": "6.10 Conclusion\nIf we have two numerical variables that have a linear association between them (also assuming there are no serious outliers), we can compute the correlation coefficient that measures the strength and direction of that linear association.\nKeep in mind that in an observational study, the correlation coefficient is a measure of association but it does not signify that one variable causes the other. It’s possible that one variable causes the other, but it’s also possible that a third “lurking” variable is responsible for all or part of the association. Either way, the fact that a relationship exists means it is possible to use values of one variable to make reasonable predictions about the values of the other variable.\nIn a properly designed experiment, the manipulation of one variable while controlling for others (and randomizing to take care of other confounders) ensures that there is a causal link between the treatment variable and the response of interest. In this case, the treatment can “explain” the response, not just predict it.\nFinally, when there is a lurking variable (confounding), we can visualize it by adding it to our scatterplots as a color aesthetic. There, we often find that associations change; they can get stronger, weaker, or even change direction altogether in the presence of that third variable.\n\n6.10.1 Preparing and submitting your assignment\n\nFrom the “Run” menu, select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”.\nDeal with any code errors that crop up.

    "section": "7.2 Regression",
    "text": "7.2 Regression\nWhen we have a linear relationship between two numerical variables, we learned in the last chapter that we can compute the correlation coefficient. One serious limitation of the correlation coefficient is that it is only a single number, and therefore, it doesn’t provide a whole lot of information about the nature of the linear relationship itself. It only gives clues as to the strength and direction of the association.\nIt will be helpful to model this linear relationship with an actual straight line. Such a line is called a regression line.\nThe idea of fitting lines and curves to data has been around for centuries, likely originating with scientists like Newton, Legendre, and Gauss who were looking for simple models to explain astronomical data. The origin of the name “regression” comes from a 19th century researcher named Francis Galton, a mentor and close associate of the eugenicist Karl Pearson, whom we discussed in the last chapter (in connection with the correlation coefficient). In fact, Galton was the person who invented the term “eugenics,” and his research legacy is just as problematic as Pearson’s.\nIn some of Galton’s less controversial work (and this part is completely above board, empirically validated, and, importantly, not racist), he noted that an unusually tall individual will have children who are still likely to be tall, but usually not as tall as the tall parent. The child’s height is likely closer to the mean height for their sex, race, etc. It “regresses” to the mean. For most phenomena, extreme observations are more likely to be followed by less extreme observations that are closer to the mean. This is very sensible and logical, and eventually leads to the idea of fitting lines to data to make realistic predictions about future observations.\nA regression line is also known as a best-fit line or least-squares line for reasons that we will get to later in the chapter.\nThe mathematics involved in figuring out what this line should be are more complicated than we cover in this book. Fortunately, R will do all the complicated calculations for us and we’ll focus on understanding what they mean.\nRecall the chredlin data set from the last chapter investigating the practice of redlining in Chicago in the 1970s. Let’s review the scatterplot of involact, the number of FAIR policies per 100 housing units, against race, the racial composition of each ZIP code as a percentage of minority residents. (Recall that each row of the data represents an entire ZIP code.)\n\nggplot(chredlin, aes(y = involact, x = race)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nDoes the Chicago redlining data come from an observational study or an experiment? How do you know?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nIf certain conditions are met, we can graph a regression line; just add a geom_smooth layer to the scatterplot:\n\nggplot(chredlin, aes(y = involact, x = race)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method = lm argument is telling ggplot to use a “linear model”. The se = FALSE argument tells ggplot to draw just the line and nothing else. (What else might it try to draw? You are encouraged to go back to the code above and take out se = FALSE to see for yourself. However, we are not yet in a position to be able to explain the gray band that appears.)\nOf all possible lines, the blue line comes the closest to each point in the scatterplot. If we wiggled the line a little bit, it might get closer to a few points, but the net effect would be to make it further from other points. This is the mathematically optimal line of best fit.",

    "text": "7.3 Models\nWe used the word “model” when referring to the regression line above. What does that word mean in this context?\nA model is something that represents something else, often on a smaller scale or in simplified form. A model is often an idealized form of something that may be quite messy or complex in reality. In statistics, a model is a representation of the way data is generated. For example, we may believe that as minority representation increases in a neighborhood, that neighborhood is more likely to be subject to racially discriminatory practices. We may even posit that the relationship is linear; i.e., for every percentage point increase in racial minorities, we expect some kind of proportional increase in racial discrimination, as measured in this case by FAIR policies. We say that this is our hypothesis about the data-generating process: we suspect that the data we see results from a sociological process that uses the minority representation of a neighborhood to generate data about FAIR policies.\nThe assumption of a linear relationship between these two quantities is just that—an assumption. It is not necessarily “true”, whatever “true” might mean in this kind of question. It is a convenient device that makes a simplifying assumption in order to allow us to do something meaningful in a statistical analysis. If such a model—despite its simplifying caricature—helps us make meaningful predictions to study something important like racial discrimination, then the model is useful.\nThe first thing we acknowledge when working with a model is that the model does not generate the data in a rigid, deterministic way. If you look at the scatterplot above, even assuming the blue line represents a “correct” data-generating process, the data points don’t fall on the blue line. The blue line gives us only a sense of where the data might be, but there is additional space between the line and the points. These spaces are often referred to as errors. In statistics, the word “error” does not mean the same thing as “mistake.” Error is just the difference between an idealized model prediction and the real location of data. In the context of linear regression, we will use the term residual instead. After the model is done making a prediction, the residuals are “left over” to account for the different between the model and the actual data.\nThe most important thing to remember about models is that they aren’t real. They are idealizations and simplifications. The degree to which we can trust models, then, comes down to certain assumptions we make about the data-generating process. These assumptions cannot be completely verified—after all, we will never know the exact data-generating process. But there are certain conditions we can check to know if the assumptions we make are reasonable.\n\nExercise 2\nDo an internet search for the phrase “statistical model” and/or “statistical modeling”. Read at least two or three sources. List below one important aspect of statistical modeling you find in your search that wasn’t mentioned in the paragraphs above. (Some of the sources you find may be a little technical. You should, for now, skip over the technical explanations. Try to find several sources that address the issue in non-technical ways. The additional information you mention below should be something non-technical that you understand.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

Therefore, it is inappropriate to fit a regression line at this point. Once the line is seen, it cannot easily be “unseen,” and it’s crucial that you don’t trick your eyes into believing there is a linear relationship before checking the conditions that justify that belief. The regression line we saw above makes no sense unless we know that regression is appropriate.\nThe conditions for running a regression analysis include all the conditions you checked for a correlation analysis in the last chapter:\n\nThe two variables must be numerical.\nThere is a somewhat linear relationship between the variables, as shown in a scatterplot.\nThere are no serious outliers.\n\n\nExercise 3\nCheck these three conditions for the regression between involact and race (using the scatterplot above for conditions (2) and (3).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is an additional condition to check to ensure that our regression model is appropriate.

    "text": "7.5 Calculating the regression line\nWhat is the equation of the regression line? In your algebra class you learned that a line takes the form \\(y = mx + b\\) where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. Statisticians write the equation in a slightly different form:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = b_{0} + b_{1} x\n\\]\nThe intercept is \\(b_{0}\\) and the slope is \\(b_{1}\\). We use \\(\\hat{y}\\) (pronounced “y hat”) instead of \\(y\\) because when we plug in values of \\(x\\), we do not get back the exact values of \\(y\\) from the data. The line, after all, does not actually pass through most (if any) actual data points. Instead, this equation gives us “predicted” values of \\(y\\) that lie on the regression line. These predicted \\(y\\) values are called \\(\\hat{y}\\).\nTo run a regression analysis and calculate the values of the intercept and slope, we use the lm command in R. (Again, lm stands for “linear model”.) This command requires us to specify a “formula” that tells R the relationship we want to model. It uses special syntax in a very specific order:\n\nThe response variable,\na “tilde” ~ (this key is usually in the upper-left corner of your keyboard, above the backtick),\nthe predictor variable.\n\nAfter a comma, we then specify the data set in which those variables live using data =. Here’s the whole command:\n\nlm(involact ~ race, data = chredlin)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = involact ~ race, data = chredlin)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)         race  \n    0.12922      0.01388  \n\n\nThe response variable always goes before the tilde and the predictor variable always goes after.\nLet’s store that result for future use. The convention we’ll use in this book is to name things using the variables involved. For example,\n\ninvolact_race_lm &lt;- lm(involact ~ race, data = chredlin)\ninvolact_race_lm\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = involact ~ race, data = chredlin)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)         race  \n    0.12922      0.01388  \n\n\nThe variable involact_race_lm now contains all the information we need about the linear regression model.",

The number 0.12922 is labeled with (Intercept), so that’s pretty obvious. But how do we know the number 0.01388 corresponds to the slope? Process of elimination, I suppose. But there’s another good reason too. The equation of the regression line can be written\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 0.12922 + 0.01388 x\n\\]\nWhen we report the equation of the regression line, we typically use words instead of \\(\\hat{y}\\) and \\(x\\) to make the equation more interpretable in the context of the problem. For example, for this data, we would write the equation as\n\\[\n\\widehat{involact} = 0.12922 + 0.01388 race\n\\]\nThe slope is the coefficient of race, or the number attached to race. (The intercept is not attached to anything; it’s just a constant term out front there.)\nThe slope \\(b_{1}\\) is always interpretable. This model predicts that one unit of increase in the x-direction corresponds to a change of 0.01388 units in the y-direction. Let’s phrase it this way:\n\nThe model predicts that an increase of one percentage point in the composition of racial minorities corresponds to an increase of 0.01388 new FAIR policies per 100 housing units.\n\nThe intercept \\(b_{0}\\) is a different story. There is always a literal interpretation:\n\nThe model predicts that a ZIP code with 0% racial minorites will generate 0.12922 new FAIR policies.\n\nIn some cases (rarely), that interpretation might make sense. In most cases, though, it is physically impossible for the predictor variable to take a value of 0, or the value 0 is way outside the range of the data. Whenever we use a model to make a prediction outside of reasonable values, we call that extrapolation.\nFor the Chicago data, we likely don’t have a case of extrapolation. While it is not literally true that any ZIP code has 0% racial minorities, we can see in the scatterplot that there are values very close to zero.\n\nExercise 4\nUse the arrange command from dplyr to sort the chredlin data frame by race (using the default ascending order). What is the value of race for the three ZIP codes with the smallest percentage of minority residents?\n\n\n# Add code here to sort by race\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nAgain, even though there are no ZIP codes with 0% racial minorities, there are a bunch that are close to zero, so the literal interpretation of the intercept is also likely a sensible one in this case.\n\n\nExercise 5\nLet’s think through something else the intercept might be telling us in this case. The presumption is that FAIR policies are obtained mostly by folks who can’t get insurance policies in other ways. Some of that is driven by racial discrimination, but maybe not all of it. What does the intercept have to say about the number of FAIR policies that are obtained not due to denial of coverage from racial discrimination?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

It’s hard to think about comparing two neighborhoods that differ by only one percent. This scale also makes the predicted change in the response variable hard to interpret. How many policies is 0.01388 per 100 housing units?\nOne way to make these kinds of statements more interpretable is to change the scale. What if we increase 10 percentage points instead of only 1 percentage point? In other words, what if we move 10 times as far along the x-axis. The response variable will also have to move 10 times as far. This is the new statement:\n\nThe model predicts that an increase of 10 percentage points in the composition of racial minorities corresponds to an increase of 0.1388 new FAIR policies per 100 housing units.\n\nIn this case, the decimal 0.1388 is maybe still not completely clear, but at least an increase of 10 percentage points is a meaningful difference between neighborhoods.\n\nExercise 6\nSince the last number is a per capita type measure, we can also rescale it.

You will not need to create a plot like this on your own, so just focus on the graph that is created below.)\n\n# You do not need to know how this code works\nggplot(chredlin, aes(y = involact, x = race)) +\n  geom_segment(x = 35.1, xend  = 35.1,\n               y = 0.6164886, yend = 0.6164886 + 0.38351139,\n               color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  geom_segment(x = 66.1, xend = 66.1,\n               y = 1.0468415, yend = 1.0468415 - 0.64684154,\n               color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the regression line and two of the residuals as red line segments. (There is a residual for all 47 ZIP codes; only two are shown in this graph.) The one on the left corresponds to ZIP code with 35% racial minority. The regression line predicts that, if the model were true, such a ZIP code would have a value of involact of about 0.6. But the actual data for that ZIP code has an involact value of 1. The residual is the difference, about 0.4. In other words, the true data point is 0.4 units higher than the model prediction. This represents a positive residual; the actual data is 0.4 units above the line. Data points that lie below the regression line have negative residuals.\n\nExercise 8\nLook at the residual on the right. This corresponds to a ZIP code with about 66% racial minorities. First, report the actual involact value for this ZIP code. (This is the location of the data point.) Next, estimate the value of involact that the model predicts for this ZIP code. (This is the y-value of the estimated point on the regression line.) Finally, subtract these two numbers to get an approximate value for the residual. Should this residual be a positive number or a negative number?\nYou can just estimate with your eyeballs for now. You don’t need to be super precise.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nMore formally, let’s call the residual \\(e\\). This is standard notation, as “e” stands for “error”. Again, though, it’s not an error in the sense of a mistake. It’s an error in the sense that the model is not perfectly accurate, so it doesn’t predict the data points exactly. The degree to which the prediction misses is the “error” or “residual”. It is given by the following formula:\n\\[\ne = y - \\hat{y}\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 9\nThere are two symbols on the right-hand side of the equation above, \\(y\\) and \\(\\hat{y}\\). Which one is the actual data value and which one is the predicted value (the one on the line)?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe residuals are used to determine the regression line. The correct regression line will be the one that results in the smallest residuals overall. How do we measure the overall set of residuals? We might think to calculate the “average” residual, but this doesn’t work. Because the regression line should go through the middle of the data, the positive residuals will cancel out the negative residuals and the mean residual will just be zero. That’s not very useful.\nInstead, what we do is square the residuals. That makes all of them positive. We then add together all the squared residuals and that sum is the thing we try to minimize. Well, we don’t do that manually because it’s hard, so we let the computer do that for us. Because the regression line minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, the regression line is often called the least-squares line.\nRecall earlier when we mentioned that there was one additional condition to check in order for linear regression to make sense. This condition is that there should not be any kind of pattern in the residuals.\nWe know that some of the points are going to lie above the line (positive residuals) and some of the points will lie below the line (negative residuals). What we need is for the spread of the residuals to be pretty balanced across the length of the regression line and for the residuals not to form any kind of curved pattern.\nTo check this condition, we’ll need to calculate the residuals first. To do so, we introduce a new function from the broom package. Whereas tidy serves up information about the intercept and the slope of the regression line, augment gives us extra information for each data point.\n\ninvolact_race_aug &lt;- augment(involact_race_lm)\ninvolact_race_aug\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe first three columns consist of the row names (the ZIP codes) followed by the actual data values we started with for involact and race. But now we’ve “augmented” the original data with some new stuff too. (We won’t learn about anything past the fifth column in this course, though.)\nThe fourth column—called .fitted—is \\(\\hat{y}\\), or the point on the line that corresponds to the given \\(x\\) value. Let’s check and make sure this is working as advertised.\nThe regression equation from above is\n\\[\n\\widehat{involact} = 0.12922 + 0.01388 race\n\\]\nTake, for example, the first row in the tibble above, the one corresponding to ZIP code 60626. The value of race is 10.0. Plug that value into the equation above:\n\\[\n\\widehat{involact} = 0.12922 + 0.01388(10.0) = 0.268\n\\]\nThe model predicts that a ZIP code with 10% racial minorities will have about 0.268 new FAIR policies per 100 housing units. The corresponding number in the .fitted column is 0.2680416, so that’s correct.\nNow skip over to the fifth column of the augment output, the one that says .resid. If this is the residual \\(e\\), then it should be \\(y - \\hat{y}\\). Since \\(y\\) is the actual value of involact and \\(\\hat{y}\\) is the value predicted by the model, we should get for the first row of output\n\\[\ne = y - \\hat{y} = 0.0 - 0.268 = -0.268\n\\]\nYup, it works!\nTo check for patterns in the residuals, we’ll create a residual plot. A residual plot graphs the residuals above each value along the x-axis. (In the command below, we also add a blue horizontal reference line so that it is clear which points have positive or negative residuals.)\n\nggplot(involact_race_aug, aes(y = .resid, x = race)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay close attention to the ggplot code. Notice that the tibble in the first slot is not chredlin as it was before. The residuals we need to plot are not stored in the raw chredlin data. We had to calculate the residuals using the augment command, and those residuals are then stored in a different place that we named involact_race_aug. In the latter tibble, the residuals themselves are stored in a variable called .resid. (Don’t forget the dot in .resid.)\nWe are looking for systematic patterns in the residuals. A good residual plot should look like the most boring plot you’ve ever seen.\nFor the most part, the residual plot above looks pretty good. The one exception is the clustering near the left edge of the graph.\n\n\nExercise 10\nRefer back and forth between the original scatterplot created earlier (with the regression line) and the residual plot above. Can you explain why there is a line of data points with negative residuals along the left edge of the residual plot?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nResidual patterns that are problematic often involve curved data (where the dots follow a curve around the horizontal reference line instead of spreading evenly around it) and heteroscedasticity, which is a fanning out pattern from left to right.\nOther than the weird cluster of points at the left, the rest of the residual plot looks pretty good. Ignoring those ZIP codes with 0 FAIR policies, the rest of the residuals stretch, on average, about the same height above and below the line across the whole width of the plot. There is only one slightly large residual at about the 40% mark, but it’s not extreme, and it doesn’t look like a severe outlier in the original scatterplot.\nWhat does a bad residual plot look like? The code below will run an ill-advised regression analysis on fire, the number of fires (per 100 housing units), against age, the percent of housing units built before 1939. The residual plot appears below.\n\nfire_age_lm &lt;- lm(fire ~ age, data = chredlin)\nfire_age_aug &lt;- augment(fire_age_lm)\nggplot(fire_age_aug, aes(y = .resid, x = age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11\nUsing the vocabulary established above, explain why the residual plot above is bad.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nOf course, we should never even get as far as running a regression analysis and making a residual plot if we perform exploratory data analysis as we’re supposed to.\n\n\nExercise 12(a)\nIf you were truly interested in investigating an association between the fire risk and the age of buildings in a ZIP code, the first thing you would do is create a scatterplot. Go ahead and do that below. Use fire as the response variable and age as the predictor.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a scatterplot of fire against age\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12(b)\nFrom the scatterplot above, explain why you wouldn’t even get as far as running a regression analysis. (Think of the conditions.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nTo review, the conditions for a regression analysis are as follows (including the newest fourth condition):\n\nThe two variables must be numerical.\nThere is a somewhat linear relationship between the variables, as shown in a scatterplot.\nThere are no serious outliers.\nThere is no pattern in the residuals.",

    "text": "7.10 \\(R^2\\)\nWe saw in the last chapter that the correlation coefficient r is of limited utility. In addition to being only a single statistic to summarize a linear association, the number doesn’t have any kind of intrinsic meaning. It can only be judged by how close it is to 0 or 1 (or -1) in conjunction with a scatterplot to give you a sense of the strength of the correlation. In particular, some people try to interpret r as some kind of percentage, but it’s not.\nOn the other hand, when we square the correlation coefficient, we do get an interpretable number. For some reason, instead of writing \\(r^2\\), statisticians write \\(R^2\\), with a capital R. (I can’t find the historical reason why this is so.) In any event, \\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as a percentage! It represents the percent of variation in the y variable that can be explained by variation in the x variable. More on what that means in a bit.\nBut first, let’s introduce the last of the broom functions: glance. Whereas tidy reports the intercept and slope, and augment reports values associated to each data point separately, the glance function gathers up summaries for the entire model. (Do not confuse glance with glimpse. The latter is a nicer version of str that just summarizes the variables in a tibble.)\n\ninvolact_race_glance &lt;- glance(involact_race_lm)\ninvolact_race_glance\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nA more advanced statistics course might discuss the other model summaries present in the glance output. The \\(R^{2}\\) value is stored in the r.squared column (inexplicably, now written with a lowercase r). Its value is 0.51. We will word it this way:\n\n51% of the variability in FAIR policies can be accounted for by variability in racial composition.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to imagine all the factors that might go into the number of FAIR policies obtained in a ZIP code. That number varies across ZIP codes, with some ZIP codes having essentially 0 FAIR policies per 100 housing units, and others having quite a bit more, up to 2 or more per 100 housing units. What accounts for this discrepancy among ZIP codes? Is it the varying racial composition of those neighborhoods? To some degree, yes. We have seen that more racially diverse neighborhoods, on average, require more FAIR policies. But is race the only factor? Probably not. Income, for example, might play a role. People in low income neighborhoods may not be able to acquire traditional insurance due to its cost or their poor credit, etc. That also accounts for some of the variability among ZIP codes. Are there likely even more factors? Most assuredly. In fact, if 51% of the variability in FAIR policies can be accounted for by variability in racial composition. then 49% must be accounted for by other variables. These other variables may or may not be collected in our data, and we will never be able to determine all the factors that go into varying FAIR policy numbers.\n\\(R^2\\) is a measure of the fit of the model. High values of \\(R^2\\) mean that the line predicts the data values closely, whereas lower values of \\(R^2\\) mean that there is still a lot of variability left in the residuals (again, due to other factors that are not measured in the model).\n\nExercise 13\nCalculate the correlation coefficient r between involact and race using the cor command. (You might have to look back at the last chapter to remember the syntax.) Store that value as r.\nIn a separate code chunk, square that value using the command r^2. Verify that the square of the correlation coefficient is the same as the \\(R^2\\) value reported in the glance output above.\n\n\n# Add code here to calculate the correlation coefficient\n\n\n# Add code here to square the correlation coefficient",

    "text": "7.11 Multiple predictors\nThe discussion of \\(R^2\\) above highlights the fact that a single predictor will rarely account for all or even most of the variability in a response variable. Is there a way to take other predictors into account?\nThe answer is yes, and the statistical technique involved is called multiple regression. Multiple regression is a deep subject, worthy of entire courses. Suffice it to say here that more advanced stats courses go into the ways in which multiple predictors can be included in a regression.\nOne easy thing we can do is incorporate a categorical variable into a graph and see if that categorical variable might play a role in the regression analysis. For example, there is a variable called side in chredlin that indicates whether the ZIP code is on the north side (n) or south side(s) of Chicago. As described in an earlier chapter, we can use color to distinguish between the ZIP codes.\n\nggplot(chredlin, aes(y = involact, x = race, color = side)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14\nDo neighborhoods with higher percent racial minorities tend to be on the north or south side of Chicago?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nDoes this affect the regression?

Assuming the conditions are met, this allows us to say more about the association. For example, the slope predicts how the response changes when comparing two values of the predictor. In fact, we can use the regression line to make a prediction for any reasonable value of the predictor (being careful not to extrapolate far outside the range of available data values). Because regression is only a model, these predictions will not be exactly correct. Real data comes with residuals, meaning deviations from the idealized predictions of the model.

A population can be a group of any size and of any type of thing in which we’re interested. Often, populations refer to groups of people. For example, in an election, the population of interest is all voters. But if you’re a biologist, you might study populations of other kinds of organisms. If you’re an engineer, you might study populations of bolts on bridges. If you’re in finance, you might study populations of loans.\nPopulations are usually inaccessible in their entirety. It is impossible to survey every voter in any reasonably sized election, for example. Therefore, to study them, we have to collect a sample. A sample is a subset of the population. We might conduct a poll of 2000 voters to try to learn about voting intentions for the entire population. Of course, for that to work, the sample has to be representative of its population. We’ll have more to say about that in the future.",

We could get an actual coin and physically flip it over and over again, but that is time-consuming and annoying. It is much easier to flip a “virtual” coin inside the computer. One way to accomplish this in R is to use the rflip command from the mosaic package. To make sure we’re flipping a fair coin, we’ll say that we want a 50% chance of heads by including the parameter prob = 0.5.\nOne more bit of technical detail. Since there will be some randomness involved here, we will need to include an R command to ensure that we all get the same results every time this code runs. This is called “setting the seed.” Don’t worry too much about what this is doing under the hood. The basic idea is that two people who start with the same seed will generate the same sequence of “random” numbers.\nThe seed 1234 in the chunk below is totally arbitrary. It could have been any number at all. (And, in fact, we’ll use different numbers just for fun.) If you change the seed, you will get different output, so we all need to use the same seed. But the actual common value we all use for the seed is irrelevant.\nHere is one coin flip with a 50% chance of coming up heads:\n\nset.seed(1234)\nrflip(1, prob = 0.5)\n\n\nFlipping 1 coin [ Prob(Heads) = 0.5 ] ...\n\nT\n\nNumber of Heads: 0 [Proportion Heads: 0]\n\n\nHere are ten coin flips, each with a 50% chance of coming up heads:\n\nset.seed(1234)\nrflip(10, prob = 0.5)\n\n\nFlipping 10 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.5 ] ...\n\nT H H H H H T T H H\n\nNumber of Heads: 7 [Proportion Heads: 0.7]\n\n\nJust to confirm that this is a random process, let’s flip ten coins again (but without setting the seed again):\n\nrflip(10, prob = 0.5)\n\n\nFlipping 10 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.5 ] ...\n\nH H T H T H T T T T\n\nNumber of Heads: 4 [Proportion Heads: 0.4]\n\n\nIf we return to the previous seed of 1234, we should obtain the same ten coin flips we did at first:\n\nset.seed(1234)\nrflip(10, prob = 0.5)\n\n\nFlipping 10 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.5 ] ...\n\nT H H H H H T T H H\n\nNumber of Heads: 7 [Proportion Heads: 0.7]\n\n\nAnd just to see the effect of setting a different seed:\n\nset.seed(9999)\nrflip(10, prob = 0.5)\n\n\nFlipping 10 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.5 ] ...\n\nH H H T H H T H H H\n\nNumber of Heads: 8 [Proportion Heads: 0.8]\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nIn ten coin flips, how many would you generally expect to come up heads? Is that the actual number of heads you saw in the simulations above? Why aren’t the simulations coming up with the expected number of heads each time?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

    "text": "8.4 Multiple simulations\nSuppose now that you are not the only person flipping coins. Suppose a bunch of people in a room are all flipping coins. We’ll start with ten coin flips per person, a task that could be reasonably done even without a computer.\nYou might observe three heads in ten flips. Fine, but what about everyone else in the room? What numbers of heads will they see?\nThe do command from mosaic is a way of doing something multiple times. Imagine there are twenty people in the room, each flipping a coin ten times, each time with a 50% probability of coming up heads. Observe:\n\nset.seed(12345)\ndo(20) * rflip(10, prob = 0.5)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe syntax could not be any simpler: do(20) * means, literally, “do twenty times.” In other words, this command is telling R to repeat an action twenty times, where the action is flipping a single coin ten times.\nYou’ll notice that in place of a list of outcomes (H or T) of all the individual flips, we have instead a summary of the number of heads and tails each person sees. Each row represents a person, and the columns give information about each person’s flips. (There are n = 10 flips for each person, but then the number of heads/tails—and the corresponding “proportion” of heads—changes from person to person.)\nLooking at the above rows and columns, we see that the output of our little coin-flipping experiment is actually stored in a data frame! Let’s give it a name and work with it.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ncoin_flips_20_10 &lt;- do(20) * rflip(10, prob = 0.5)\ncoin_flips_20_10\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt is significant that we can store our outcomes this way. Because we have a data frame, we can apply all our data analysis tools (graphs, charts, tables, summary statistics, etc.) to the “data” generated from our set of simulations.\nFor example, what is the mean number of heads these twenty people observed?\n\nmean(coin_flips_20_10$heads)\n\n[1] 5.6\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nThe data frame coin_flips_20_10 contains four variables: n, heads, tails, and prop. In the code chunk above, we calculated mean(coin_flips_20_10$heads) which gave us the mean count of heads for all people flipping coins. Instead of calculating the mean count of heads, change the variable from heads to prop to calculate the mean proportion of heads. Then explain why your answer makes sense in light of the mean count of heads calculated above.\n\n\n# Add code here to calculate the mean proportion of heads.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nLet’s look at a histogram of the number of heads we see in the simulated flips. (The fancy stuff in scale_x_continuous is just making sure that the x-axis goes from 0 to 10 and that the tick marks appear on each whole number.)\n\nggplot(coin_flips_20_10, aes(x = heads)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 10, 1))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s do the same thing, but now let’s consider the proportion of heads.\n\nggplot(coin_flips_20_10, aes(x = prop)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).",

    "text": "8.5 Bigger and better!\nWith only twenty people, it was possible that, for example, nobody would get all heads or all tails. Indeed, in coin_flips_20_10 there were no people who got all heads or all tails. Also, there were more people with six and seven heads than with five heads, even though we “expected” the average to be five heads. There is nothing particularly significant about that; it happened by pure chance alone. Another run through the above commands would generate a somewhat different outcome. That’s what happens when things are random.\nInstead, let’s imagine that we recruited way more people to flip coins with us. Let’s try it again with 2000 people:\n\nset.seed(1234)\ncoin_flips_2000_10 &lt;- do(2000) * rflip(10, prob = 0.5)\ncoin_flips_2000_10\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is the same idea as before, but now there are 2000 rows in the data frame instead of 20.\n\nmean(coin_flips_2000_10$heads)\n\n[1] 5.0245\n\n\n\nggplot(coin_flips_2000_10, aes(x = heads)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 10, 1))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is helpful. In contrast with the set of simulations with twenty people, the last histogram gives us something closer to what we expect. The mode is at five heads, and every possible number of heads is represented, with decreasing counts as one moves away from five. With 2000 people flipping coins, all possible outcomes—including rare ones—are better represented.\nHere is the the same histogram, but this time with the proportion of heads instead of the count of heads:\n\nggplot(coin_flips_2000_10, aes(x = prop)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nDo you think the shape of the distribution would be appreciably different if we used 20,000 or even 200,000 people? Why or why not? (Normally, I would encourage you to test your theory by trying it in R. However, it takes a long time to simulate that many flips and I don’t want you to tie up resources and memory. Think through this in your head.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nFrom now on, we will insist on using at least a thousand simulations—if not more—to make sure that we represent the full range of possible outcomes.1",

    "section": "8.7 But who cares about coin flips?",
    "text": "8.7 But who cares about coin flips?\nIt’s fair to ask why we go to all this trouble to talk about coin flips. The most pressing research questions of our day do not involve people sitting around and flipping coins, either physically or virtually.\nBut now substitute “heads” and “tails” with “cancer” and “no cancer”. Or “guilty” and “not guilty”. Or “shot” and “not shot”. The fact is that many important issues are measured as variables with two possible outcomes. There is some underlying “probability” of seeing one outcome over the other. (It doesn’t have to be 50% like the coin.) Statistical methods—including simulation—can say a lot about what we “expect” to see if these outcomes are truly random. More importantly, when we see outcomes that aren’t consistent with our simulations, we may wonder if there is some underlying mechanism that may be not so random after all. It may not look like it on first blush, but this idea is at the core of the scientific method.\nFor example, let’s suppose that 85% of U.S. adults support some form of background checks for gun buyers.2 Now, imagine we went out and surveyed a random group of people and asked them a simple yes/no question about their support for background checks. What might we see?\nLet’s simulate. Imagine flipping a coin, but instead of coming up heads 50% of the time, suppose it were possible for the coin to come up heads 85% of the time.3 A sequence of heads and tails with this weird coin would be much like randomly surveying people and asking them about background checks.\nWe can make a “virtual” weird coin with the rflip command by specifying how often we want heads to come up.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nrflip(1, prob = 0.85)\n\n\nFlipping 1 coin [ Prob(Heads) = 0.85 ] ...\n\nH\n\nNumber of Heads: 1 [Proportion Heads: 1]\n\n\nIf we flip our weird coin a bunch of times, we can see that our coin is not fair. Indeed, it appears to come up heads way more often than not:\n\nset.seed(1234)\nrflip(100, prob = 0.85)\n\n\nFlipping 100 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.85 ] ...\n\nH H H H T H H H H H H H H T H H H H H H H H H H H H H T H H H H H H H H\nH H T H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H T H H H H H H H H H H T\nH H H H H H H H T H H H H T H H H T H T H H H H H H H H\n\nNumber of Heads: 90 [Proportion Heads: 0.9]\n\n\nThe results from the above code can be thought of as a survey of 100 random U.S. adults about their support for background checks for purchasing guns. “Heads” means “supports” and “tails” means “opposes.” If the majority of Americans support background checks, then we will come across more people in our survey who tell us they support background checks. This shows up in our simulation as the appearance of more heads than tails.\nNote that there is no guarantee that our sample will have exactly 85% heads. In fact, it doesn’t; it has 90% heads.\nAgain, keep in mind that we’re simulating the act of obtaining a random sample of 100 U.S. adults. If we get a different sample, we’ll get different results. (We set a different seed here. That ensures that this code chunk is randomly different from the one above.)\n\nset.seed(123456)\nrflip(100, prob = 0.85)\n\n\nFlipping 100 coins [ Prob(Heads) = 0.85 ] ...\n\nH H H H H H H H T H H H T T T T T H H H H H H H H H T T T H H T H H H H\nT T H H H H T H H H H H H H H H H T H T H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H\nT H H H T H H H H H H T H H H H H H H H H H H H T H H H\n\nNumber of Heads: 81 [Proportion Heads: 0.81]\n\n\nSee, this time, only 81% came up heads, even though we expected 85%. That’s how randomness works.\n\nExercise 6(a)\nNow imagine that 2000 people all go out and conduct surveys of 100 random U.S. adults, asking them about their support for background checks. Write some R code that simulates this. Plot a histogram of the results. (Hint: you’ll need do(2000) * in there.) Use the proportion of supporters (prop), not the raw count of supporters (heads).\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n# Add code here to simulate 2000 surveys of 100 U.S. adults.\n\n\n# Plot the results in a histogram using proportions.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6(b)\nRun another simulation, but this time, have each person survey 1000 adults and not just 100.\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n# Add code here to simulate 2000 surveys of 1000 U.S. adults.\n\n\n# Plot the results in a histogram using proportions.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6(c)\nWhat changed when you surveyed 1000 people instead of 100?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

We don’t expect the results of each survey to be exactly the same every time the survey is administered.\nBut despite this randomness, there is an interesting pattern that we can observe. It has to do with the number of times we flip the coin. Since we’re using coin flips to simulate the act of conducting a survey, the number of coin flips is playing the role of the sample size. In other words, if we want to simulate a survey of U.S. adults with a sample size of 100, we simulate that by flipping 100 coins.\n\nExercise 7\nGo back and look at all the examples above. What do you notice about the range of values on the x-axis when the sample size is small versus large?

The availability of fast computer processing makes simulation easy and accessible. Eventually, the goal will be to use simulation to answer important questions about data and the processes in the world that generate data. This is possible because, despite the ubiquitous presence of randomness, a certain order emerges when the number of samples is large enough.

Recall that we always list the response variable first. That way, the column sums will show us how many observations are in each of the predictor groups.\nAlso, note the use of the “pipe” |&gt; here. Normally, the tabyl function requires as its first argument the name of the data frame, followed by the names of any variables that you want in the table. Here, though, the data frame (sex_discrimination) gets fed into the tabyl function through the pipe. Because of that, the tabyl function only requires the names of the two variables.\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nCreate another contingency table of decision and sex, but this time with percentages (not proportions) instead of counts. You’ll probably have to go back to the “Categorical data” to review the syntax. (Hint: you should have three separate adorn functions on the lines following the tabyl command.)\n\n\n# Add code here to create a contingency table of percentages\n\n\n\nAlthough we can read off the percentages in the contingency table, we need to do computations using the proportions. (Remember that we use percentages to communicate with other human beings, but we do math with proportions.) Fortunately, the output of tabyl is a tibble! So we can manipulate and grab the elements we need.\nLet’s create and store the tabyl output with proportions. We don’t need the marginal distribution, so we can dispense with adorn_totals.\n\ndecision_sex_tabyl &lt;- sex_discrimination |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\")\ndecision_sex_tabyl\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nInterpret these proportions in the context of the data. In other words, what do these proportions say about the male files that were recommended for promotion versus the female files recommended for promotion?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThe real statistic of interest to us is the difference between these proportions. We can use the mutate command from dplyr to compute the difference for us.\n\ndecision_sex_tabyl |&gt;\n  mutate(diff = male - female)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, once we know the difference in promotion rates, we don’t really need the individual proportions anymore. The transmute verb is a version of mutate that gives us exactly what we want. It will create a new column just like mutate, but then it keeps only that new column. We’ll call the resulting output decision_sex_diff.\n\ndecision_sex_diff &lt;- decision_sex_tabyl |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female)\ndecision_sex_diff\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNotice the order of subtraction: we’re doing the men’s rates minus the women’s rates.\nThis computes both the difference in promotion rates (in the first row) and the difference in not-promoted rates (in the second row). Let’s just keep the first row, since we care more about promotion rates. (That’s our success category.) We can use slice to grab the first row:\n\ndecision_sex_diff |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis means that there is a 29% difference between the male files that were promoted and the female files that were promoted. The difference was computed as males minus females, so the fact that the number is positive means that male files were more likely to recommended for promotion.",

    "text": "9.4 Permuting\nOne way to see if there is evidence of an association between promotion decisions and sex is to assume, temporarily, that there is no association. If there were truly no association, then the difference between the promotion rates between the male files and female files should be 0%. Of course, the number of people promoted in the data was 35, an odd number, so the number of male files promoted and female files promoted cannot be the same. Therefore, the difference in proportions can’t be exactly zero in this data. Nevertheless, we would expect—under the assumption of no association—the number of male files promoted to be close to the number of female files promoted, giving a difference around 0%.\nNow, we saw a difference of about 29% between the two groups in the data. Then again, non-zero differences—sometimes even large ones—can just come about by pure chance alone. We may have accidentally sampled more bank managers who just happened to prefer the male candidates. This could happen for sexist reasons; it’s possible our sample of bank managers are, by chance, more sexist than bank managers in the general population during the 1970s. Or it might be for more benign reasons; perhaps the male applications got randomly steered to bank managers who were more likely to be impressed with any application, and therefore, they were more likely to promote anyone regardless of the gender listed. We have to consider the possibility that our observed difference was large by accident, even though there may have been no association between promotion and sex in the general population.\nSo how do we test the range of values that could arise from just chance alone? In other words, how do we explore sampling variability?\nOne way to force the variables to be independent is to “permute”—in other words, shuffle—the values of sex in our data. If we ignore the sex listed in the file and give it a random label (independent of the actual sex listed in the file), we know for sure that such an assignment is random and not due to any actual evidence of sexism. In that case, promotion is equally likely to occur in both groups.\nLet’s see how permuting works in R. To begin with, look at the actual values of sex in our data:\n\nsex_discrimination$sex\n\n [1] male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male  \n[11] male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male   male  \n[21] male   male   male   male   female female female female female female\n[31] female female female female female female female female female female\n[41] female female female female female female female female\nLevels: male female\n\n\nAll the males happen to be listed first, followed by all the females.\nNow we permute all the values around (using the sample command). As explained in an earlier chapter, we will set the seed so that our results are reproducible.\n\nset.seed(3141593)\nsample(sex_discrimination$sex)\n\n [1] male   female male   male   female female female female female female\n[11] female female female female male   male   female male   female male  \n[21] female female male   male   female female male   female male   male  \n[31] male   male   male   female male   female male   male   male   male  \n[41] female female female male   male   male   female male  \nLevels: male female\n\n\nDo it again without the seed, just to make sure it’s truly random:\n\nsample(sex_discrimination$sex)\n\n [1] male   male   male   female male   female male   female female female\n[11] female male   female male   female female female female male   male  \n[21] female female female male   male   female male   male   male   female\n[31] male   male   male   male   male   female female female female male  \n[41] female female male   male   male   female female male  \nLevels: male female",

    "text": "9.5 Randomization\nThe idea here is to keep the promotion status the same for each file, but randomly permute the sex labels. There will still be the same number of male and female files, but now they will be randomly matched with promoted files and not promoted files. Since this new grouping into “males” and “females” is completely random and arbitrary, we expect the likelihood of promotion to be equal for both groups.\nA more precise way of saying this is that the expected difference under the assumption of independent variables is 0%. If there were truly no association, then the percentage of people promoted would be independent of sex. However, sampling variability means that we are not likely to see an exact difference of 0%. (Also, as we mentioned earlier, the odd number of promotions means the difference will never be exactly 0% anyway in this data.) The real question, then, is how different could the difference be from 0% and still be reasonably possible due to random chance.\nLet’s perform a few random simulations. We’ll walk through the steps one line at a time. The first thing we do is permute the sex column:\n\nset.seed(3141593)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen we follow the steps from earlier, generating a contingency table with proportions. This is accomplished by simply adding two lines of code to the previous code:\n\nset.seed(3141593)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that the proportions in this table are different from the ones in the real data.\nThen we calculate the difference between the male and female columns by adding a line with transmute:\n\nset.seed(3141593)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn this case, the first row happens to be negative, but that’s okay. This particular random shuffling had more females promoted than males. (Remember, though, that the permuted sex labels are now meaningless.)\nFinally, we grab the entry in the first row with slice:\n\nset.seed(3141593)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe’ll repeat this code a few more times, but without the seed, to get new random observations.\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = sample(sex)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(decision, sex) |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  transmute(diff = male - female) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThink carefully about what these random numbers mean. Each time we randomize, we get a simulated difference in the proportion of promotions between male files and female files. The sample part ensures that there is no actual relationship between promotion and sex among these randomized values. We expect each simulated difference to be close to zero, but we also expect deviations from zero due to randomness and chance.",

    "text": "9.8 By chance?\nHow likely is it that the observed difference (or a difference even more extreme) could have resulted from chance alone? Because sims_1 contains simulated results after permuting, the values in the stat column assume that promotion is independent of sex. In order to assess how plausible our observed difference is under that assumption, we want to find out how many of the simulated values are at least as big, if not bigger, than the observed difference, 0.292.\nLook at the randomized differences sorted in decreasing order:\n\nsims_1 |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(stat))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOf the 1000 simulations, the most extreme difference of 37.5% occurred four times, just by chance. That seems like a pretty extreme value when expecting a value of 0%, but the laws of probability tell us that extreme values will be observed from time to time, even if rarely. Also recall that the observed difference in the actual data was 29.2%. This specific value came up quite a bit in our simulated data. In fact, the 31st entry of the sorted data above is the last occurrence of the value 0.292. After that, the next higher larger value is 0.208.\nSo let’s return to the original question. How many simulated values are as large—if not larger—than the observed difference? Apparently, 31 out of 1000, which is 0.031. In other words, 3% of the simulated data is as extreme or more extreme than the actual difference in promotion rates between male files and female files in the real data. That’s not very large. In other words, a difference like 29.2% could occur just by chance—like flipping 5 out of 5 heads or something like that. But it doesn’t happen very often.\nWe can automate this calculation using the function get_p_value (similar to shade_p_value above) even though we don’t yet know what “p value” means.\n\nsims_1 |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_1, direction = \"greater\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCOPY/PASTE WARNING: If the observed difference were negative, then extreme values of interest would be less than, say, -0.292, not greater than 0.292. You must note if the observed difference is positive or negative and then use “greater” or “less” as appropriate!\nAgain, 0.031 is a small number. This shows us that if there were truly no association between promotion and sex, then our data is a rare event. (An observed difference this extreme or more extreme would only occur about 3% of the time by chance.)\nBecause the probability above is so small, it seems unlikely that our variables are independent. Therefore, it seems more likely that there is an association between promotion and sex. We have evidence of a statistically discernible difference between the chance of getting recommended for promotion if the file indicates male versus female.\nBecause this is an experiment, it’s possible that a causal claim could be made. If everything in the application files was identical except the indication of gender, then it stands to reason that gender explains why more male files were promoted over female files. But all that depends on the experiment being a well-designed experiment.\n\nExercise 7\nAlthough we are not experts in experimental design, what concerns do you have about generalizing the results of this experiment to broad conclusions about sexism in the 1970s? (To be clear, I’m not saying that sexism wasn’t a broad problem in the 1970s. It surely was—and still is. I’m only asking you to opine as to why the results of this one study might not be conclusive in making an overly broad statement.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.",

In the ucb_admit data, they all start with uppercase letters, so you’ll need to be careful to change that after you copy and paste code examples from above.\n\nExercise 8(a)\nIs this data observational or experimental?

Use the specify, hypothesize, generate, and calculate sequence from the infer package as above. Call the simulated data frame sims_2 so that it doesn’t conflict with the earlier sims_1.

When you first run the code, remove the bins = 9 we had earlier and let visualize choose the number of bins. If you are satisfied with the graph, you don’t need to specify a number of bins. If you are not satisfied, you can experiment with the number of bins until you find a number that seems reasonable.\nBe sure to include a vertical line at the value of the observed difference using the shade_p_value command.

Based on the histogram above, is the observed difference in the data rare? In other words, under the assumption that admission and gender are independent, are we likely to see an observed difference as far away from zero as we actually see in the data?

    "text": "9.10 Simpson’s paradox\nThe example above from UC Berkeley seems like an open and shut case. Male applicants were clearly admitted at a greater rate than female applicants. While we never expect the application rates to be exactly equal—even under the assumption that admission and gender are independent—the randomization exercise showed us that the observed data was way outside the range of possible differences that could have occurred just by chance.\nBut we also know this is observational data. Association is not causation.\n\nExercise 9\nNote that we didn’t say “correlation is not causation”. The latter is also true, but why does it not apply in this case? (Think about the conditions for correlation.)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nSince we don’t have data from a carefully controlled experiment, we always have to be worried about lurking variables. Could there be a third variable apart from admission and gender that could be driving the association between them? In other words, the fact that males were admitted at a higher rate than females might be sexism, or it might be spurious.\nSince we have access to a third variable, Dept, let’s analyze it as well. The tabyl command will happily take a third variable and create a set of contingency tables, one for each department.\nHere are the tables with counts:\n\nucb_admit |&gt;\n  tabyl(Admit, Gender, Dept) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals()\n\n$A\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted  512     89\n Rejected  313     19\n    Total  825    108\n\n$B\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted  353     17\n Rejected  207      8\n    Total  560     25\n\n$C\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted  120    202\n Rejected  205    391\n    Total  325    593\n\n$D\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted  138    131\n Rejected  279    244\n    Total  417    375\n\n$E\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted   53     94\n Rejected  138    299\n    Total  191    393\n\n$F\n    Admit Male Female\n Admitted   22     24\n Rejected  351    317\n    Total  373    341\n\n\nAnd here are the tables with percentages:\n\nucb_admit |&gt;\n  tabyl(Admit, Gender, Dept) |&gt;\n  adorn_totals() |&gt;\n  adorn_percentages(\"col\") |&gt;\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n$A\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted  62.1%  82.4%\n Rejected  37.9%  17.6%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n$B\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted  63.0%  68.0%\n Rejected  37.0%  32.0%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n$C\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted  36.9%  34.1%\n Rejected  63.1%  65.9%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n$D\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted  33.1%  34.9%\n Rejected  66.9%  65.1%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n$E\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted  27.7%  23.9%\n Rejected  72.3%  76.1%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n$F\n    Admit   Male Female\n Admitted   5.9%   7.0%\n Rejected  94.1%  93.0%\n    Total 100.0% 100.0%\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nLook at the contingency tables with percentages. Examine each department individually. What do you notice about the admit rates (as percentages) between males and females for most of the departments listed? Identify the four departments where female admission rates were higher than male admission rates.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nThis is completely counterintuitive. How can males be admitted at a higher rate overall, and yet in most departments, females were admitted at a higher rate?\nThis phenomenon is often called Simpson’s Paradox. Like almost everything in statistics, this is named after a person (Edward H. Simpson) who got the popular credit for writing about the phenomenon, but who wasn’t the person who actually discovered the phenomenon. (There does not appear to be a primeval reference for the first person to have studied it. Similar observations had appeared in various sources more than 50 years before Simpson wrote his paper.)\nWe saw several versions of this paradox in Chapter 6 when we considered the inclusion of a lurking variable as color in a scatterplot. Both the bdims (body measurements) and the penguins data sets showed examples of the strength and even the direction of correlations changing when considering a lurking variable.\n\n\nExercise 11\nLook at the contingency tables with counts. Focus on the four departments you identified in the exercise above (where female admission rates were higher than male admission rates). What is true of the total number of male and female applicants for those four department (and not for the other two departments)?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 12(a)\nNow create a contingency table with percentages that uses Admit for the row variable and Dept as the column variable.\n\n\n# Add code here to create a contingency table\n# with percentages for Dept and Admit\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12(b)\nAccording to the contingency table above, which two departments were (by far) the least selective? (In other words, which two departments admitted a vast majority of their applicants?)\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\n\nExercise 12(c)\nEarlier, you identified four departments that had higher admission rates for females. These were the same departments in which male applicants outnumbered female applicants. But for which two departments was the difference between the number of male and female applicants the largest?\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nYour work in the previous exercises begins to paint a picture that explains what’s going on with this “paradox.” Males applied in much greater numbers to a few departments with high acceptance rates. As a result, more male students overall got in to graduate school. Females applied in greater numbers to departments that were more selective. Overall, then, fewer females got in to graduate school. But on a department-by-department basis, female applicants were usually more likely to get accepted.\nNone of this suggests that sexism fails to exist. It doesn’t even prove that sexism wasn’t a factor in some departmental admission procedures. What it does suggest is that when we don’t take into account possible lurking variables, we run the risk of oversimplifying issues that are potentially complex.\nIn our analysis of the UC Berkeley data, we’ve exhausted all the variables available to us in the data set. There remains the potential for unmeasured confounders, or variables that could still act as lurking variables, but we have no idea about them because they aren’t in our data. This is an unavoidable peril of working with observational data. If we aren’t careful to “control” for a reasonable set of possible lurking variables, we must be very careful when trying to make broad conclusions.",

When we assume they are independent, we can explore the sampling variability of the differences that could occur by pure chance alone. We expect the difference to be zero, but we know that randomness will cause the simulated differences to have a range of values. Is the difference in the observed data far away from zero? In that case, we can say we have evidence that the variables are not independent; in other words, it is more likely that our variables are associated.\nAs we’ve pointed out before, even when we have evidence of an association between variables, we always need to be careful about stating conclusions. Sometimes our conclusions are misleading, for example, when we fail to consider the effect of lurking/confounding variables in the analysis.\n\n9.11.1 Preparing and submitting your assignment\n\nFrom the “Run” menu, select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”.\nDeal with any code errors that crop up.

    "text": "10.3 Hypothesis testing\nThe approach we used in “Introduction to randomization, Part 2” was to assume that the two variables decision and sex were independent. From that assumption, we were able to compare the observed difference in promotion percentages between males and females from the actual data to the distribution of random values obtained by randomization. When the observed difference was far enough away from zero, we concluded that the assumption of independence was probably false, giving us evidence that the two variables were associated after all.\nThis logic is formalized into a sequence of steps known as a hypothesis test. In this section, we will introduce a rubric for conducting a full and complete hypothesis test for the sex discrimination example. (This rubric also appears in the Appendix. If you need the rubric as a file, you can also download copies either as a .qmd file here or as an html file here.)\nA hypothesis test can be organized into five parts:\n\nExploratory data analysis\nHypotheses\nModel\nMechanics\nConclusion\n\nBelow, I’ll address each of these steps.\n\n10.3.1 Exploratory data analysis\nBefore we can answer questions using data, we need to understand our data.\nMost data sets come with some information about the provenance and structure of the data. (Often this is called “metadata.”) Data provenance is the story of how the data was collected and for what purpose. Together with some information about the types of variables recorded, this is the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Without context, data is just a bunch of letters and numbers. You must understand the nature of the data in order to use the data. Information about the structure of the data is often recorded in a “code book.”\nFor data that you collect yourself, you’ll already know all about it, although should probably write that stuff down in case other people want to use your data (or in case “future you” wants to use the data). For other data sets, you hope that other people have recorded information about how the data was collected and what is described in the data. When working with data sets in R as we do for these chapters, we’ve already seen that there are help files—sometimes more or less helpful. In some cases, you’ll need to go beyond the brief explanations in the help file to investigate the data provenance. And for files we download from other places on the internet, we may have a lot of work to do.\n\nExercise 1\nWhat are some ethical issues you might want to consider when looking into the provenance of data? Have a discussion with a classmate and/or do some internet sleuthing to see if you can identify one or two key issues that should be considered before you access or analyze data.\n\nPlease write up your answer here.\n\n\nFor exploring the raw data in front of us, we can use commands like View from the Console to see the data in spreadsheet form, although if we’re using Quarto documents, we can just type the name of the data frame in a code chunk and run it to print the data in a form we can navigate and explore. There is also glimpse to explore the structure of the data (the variables and how they’re coded), as well as other summary functions to get a quick sense of the variables.\nSometimes you have to prepare your data for analysis. A common example is converting categorical variables that should be coded as factor variables, but often are coded as character vectors, or are coded numerically (like “1” and “0” instead of “Yes” and “No”). Sometimes missing data is coded unusually (like “999”) and that has to be fixed before trying to calculate statistics. “Cleaning” data in the real world is often a task that takes more time than analyzing it!\nFinally, once the data is in a suitably tidy form, we can use visualizations like tables, graphs, and charts to understand the data better. Often, there are conditions about the shape of our data that have to be met before inference is appropriate, and this step can help diagnose problems that could arise in the inferential procedure. This is a good time to look for outliers, for example.\n\n\n\n10.3.2 Hypotheses\nWe are trying to ask some question about a population of interest. However, all we have in our data is a sample of that population. The word inference comes from the verb “infer”: we are trying to infer what might be true of a population just from examining a sample. It’s also possible that our question involves comparing two or more populations to each other. In this case, we’ll have multiple samples, one from each of our populations. For example, in our sex discrimination example, we are comparing two populations: male bank managers who consider male files for promotion, and male bank managers who consider female files for promotion. Our data gives us two samples who form only a part of the larger populations of interest.\nTo convince our audience that our analysis is correct, it makes sense to take a skeptical position. If we are trying to prove that there is an association between promotion and sex, we don’t just declare it to be so. We start with a “null hypothesis”, or an expression of the belief that there is no association. A null hypothesis always represents the “default” position that a skeptic might take. It codifies the idea that “there’s nothing to see here.”\nOur job is to gather evidence to show that there is something interesting going on. The statement of interest to us is called the “alternative hypothesis.” This is usually the thing we’re trying to prove related to our research question.\nWe can perform one-sided tests or two-sided tests. A one-sided test is when we have a specific direction in mind for the effect. For example, if we are trying to prove that male files are more likely to be promoted than female files, then we would perform a one-sided test. On the other hand, if we only care about proving an association, then male files could be either more likely or less likely to be promoted than female files. (This is contrasted to the null that states that male files are equally likely to be promoted as female files.) If it seems weird to run a two-sided test, keep in mind that we want to give our statistical analysis a chance to prove an association regardless of the direction of the association. Wouldn’t you be interested to know if it turned out that male files were, in fact, less likely to be promoted?\nYou can’t cheat and look at the data first. In a normal research study out there in the real world, you develop hypotheses long before you collect data. So you have to decide to do a one-sided or two-sided test before you have the luxury of seeing your data pointing in one direction or the other.\nRunning a two-sided test is often a good default option. Again, this is because our analysis will allow us to show interesting effects in any direction.\nWe typically express hypotheses in two ways. First, we write down full sentences that express in the context of the problem what our null and alternative hypotheses are stating. Then, we express the same ideas as mathematical statements. This translation from words to math is important as it gives us the connection to the quantitative statistical analysis we need to perform. The null hypothesis will always be that some quantity is equal to (=) the null value. The alternative hypothesis depends on whether we are conducting a one-sided test or a two-sided test. A one-sided test is mathematically saying that the quantity of interest is either greater than (&gt;) or less than (&lt;) the null value. A two-sided test always states that the quantity of interest is not equal to (\\(\\neq\\)) the null value. (Notice the math symbol enclosed in dollar signs in the previous sentence. In the HTML file, these symbols will appear correctly. In the Quarto document, you can hover the cursor anywhere between the dollar signs and the math symbol will show up. Alternatively, you can click somewhere between the dollar signs and hit Ctrl-Enter or Cmd-Enter, just like with inline R code.)\nThe most important thing to know is that the entire hypothesis test, up until you reach the conclusion, is conducted under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, we pretend the whole time that our alternative hypothesis is false, and we carry out our analysis working under that assumption. This may seem odd, but it makes sense when you remember that the goal of inference is to try to convince a skeptic. Others will only believe your claim after you present evidence that suggests that the data is inconsistent with the claims made in the null.\n\n\n10.3.3 Model\nA model is an approximation—usually a simplification—of reality. In a hypothesis test, when we say “model” we are talking specifically about the “null model”. In other words, what is true about the population under the assumption of the null? If we sample from the population repeatedly, we find that there is some kind of distribution of values that can occur by pure chance alone. This is called the sampling distribution model. We have been learning about how to use randomization to understand the sampling distribution and how much sampling variability to expect, even when the null hypothesis is true.\nBuilding a model is contingent upon certain assumptions being true. We cannot usually demonstrate directly that these assumptions are conclusively met; however, there are often conditions that can be checked with our data that can give us some confidence in saying that the assumptions are probably met. For example, there is no hope that we can infer anything from our sample unless that sample is close to a random sample of the population. There is rarely any direct evidence of having a properly random sample, and often, random samples are too much to ask for. There is almost never such a thing as a truly random sample of the population. Nevertheless, it is up to us to make the case that our sample is as representative of the population as possible. Additionally, we have to know that our sample comprises less than 10% of the size of the population. The reasons for this are somewhat technical and the 10% figure is just a rough guideline, but we should think carefully about this whenever we want our inference to be correct.\nThose are just two examples. For the randomization tests we are running, those are the only two conditions we need to check. For other hypothesis tests in the future that use different types of models, we will need to check more conditions that correspond to the modeling assumptions we will need to make.\n\n\n10.3.4 Mechanics\nThis is the nitty-gritty, nuts-and-bolts part of a hypothesis test. Once we have a model that tells us how data should behave under the assumption of the null hypothesis, we need to check how our data actually behaved. The measure of where our data is relative to the null model is called the test statistic. For example, if the null hypothesis states that there should be a difference of zero between promotion rates for males and females, then the test statistic would be the actual observed difference in our data between males and females.\nOnce we have a test statistic, we can plot it in the same graph as the null model. This gives us a visual sense of how rare or unusual our observed data is. The further our test statistic is from the center of the null model, the more evidence we have that our data would be very unusual if the null model were true. And that, in turn, gives us a reason not to believe the null model. When conducting a two-sided test, we will actually graph locations on both side of the null value: the test statistic on one side of the null value and a point the same distance on the other side of the null value. This will acknowledge that we’re interested in evidence of an effect in either direction.\nFinally, we convert the visual evidence explained in the previous paragraph to a number called a P-value. This measures how likely it is to see our observed data—or data even more extreme—under the assumption of the null. A small P-value, then, means that if the null were really true, we wouldn’t be very likely at all to see data like ours. That leaves us with little confidence that the null model is really true. (After all, we did see the data we gathered!) If the P-value is large—in other words, if the test statistic is closer to the middle of the null distribution—then our data is perfectly consistent with the null hypothesis. That doesn’t mean the null is true, but it certainly does not give us evidence against the null.\nA one-sided test will give us a P-value that only counts data more extreme than the observed data in the direction that we explicitly hypothesized. For example, if our alternative hypothesis was that male files are more likely to be promoted, then we would only look at the part of the model that showed differences with as many or more male promotions as our data showed. A two-sided P-value, by contrast, will count data that is extreme in either direction. This will include values on both sides of the distribution, which is why it’s called a two-sided test. Computationally, it is usually easiest to calculate the one-sided P-value and just double it.1\nRemember the statement made earlier that throughout the hypothesis testing process, we work under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The P-value is no exception. It tells us under the assumption of the null how likely we are to to see data at least as extreme (if not even more extreme) as the data we actually saw.\n\n\n10.3.5 Conclusion\nThe P-value we calculate in the Mechanics section allows us to determine what our decision will be relative to the null hypothesis. As explained above, when the P-value is small, that means we had data that would be very unlikely had the null been true. The sensible conclusion is then to “reject the null hypothesis.” On the other hand, if the data is consistent with the null hypothesis, then we “fail to reject the null hypothesis.”\nHow small does the P-value need to be before we are willing to reject the null hypothesis? That is a decision we have to make based on how much we are willing to risk an incorrect conclusion. A value that is widely used is 0.05; in other words, if \\(P &lt; 0.05\\) we reject the null, and if \\(P &gt; 0.05\\), we fail to reject the null. However, for situations where we want to be conservative, we could choose this threshold to be much smaller. If we insist that the P-value be less than 0.01, for example, then we will only reject the null when we have a lot more evidence. The threshold we choose is called the “significance level”, denoted by the Greek letter alpha: \\(\\alpha\\). The value of \\(\\alpha\\) must be chosen long before we compute our P-value so that we’re not tempted to cheat and change the value of \\(\\alpha\\) to suit our P-value (and by doing so, quite literally, move the goalposts). While there is nothing magical about an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.05, this is a well-established (if arbitrary and meaningless) convention in most of the research world. Unless we state otherwise, always assume for purposes of the exercises in this book that we are using a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\nNote that we never accept the null hypothesis. The hypothesis testing procedure gives us no evidence in favor of the null. All we can say is that the evidence is either strong enough to warrant rejection of the null, or else it isn’t, in which case we can conclude nothing. If we can’t prove the null false, we are left not knowing much of anything at all.\nThe phrases “reject the null” or “fail to reject the null” are very statsy. Your audience may not be statistically trained. Besides, the real conclusion you care about concerns the research question of interest you posed at the beginning of this process, and that is built into the alternative hypothesis, not the null. Therefore, we need some statement that addresses the alternative hypothesis in words that a general audience will understand. we recommend the following templates:\n\nWhen you reject the null, you can safely say, “We have sufficient evidence that [restate the alternative hypothesis].”\nWhen you fail to reject the null, you can safely say, “We have insufficient evidence that [restate the alternative hypothesis].”\n\nThe last part of your conclusion should be an acknowledgement of the uncertainty in this process. Statistics tries to tame randomness, but in the end, randomness is always somewhat unpredictable. It is possible that we came to the wrong conclusion, not because we made mistakes in our computation, but because statistics just can’t be right 100% of the time when randomness is involved. Therefore, we need to explain to our audience that we may have made an error.\nA Type I error is what happens when the null hypothesis is actually true, but our procedure rejects it anyway. This happens when we get an unrepresentative extreme sample for some reason. For example, perhaps there really is no association between promotion and sex. Even if that were true, we could accidentally survey a group of bank managers who—by pure chance alone—happen to recommend promotion more often for the male files. Our test statistic will be “accidentally” far from the null value, and we will mistakenly reject the null. Whenever we reject the null, we are at risk of making a Type I error. Given that we are conclusively stating a statistically discernible finding, if that finding is wrong, this is a false positive, a term that is synonymous with a Type I error. The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) discussed above is, in fact, the probability of making a Type I error. (If the null is true, we will still reject the null if our P-value happens to be less than \\(\\alpha\\).)\nOn the other hand, the null may actually be false, and yet, we may not manage to gather enough evidence to disprove it. This can also happen due to an unusual sample—a sample that doesn’t conform to the “truth”. But there are other ways this can happen as well, most commonly when you have a small sample size (which doesn’t allow you to prove much of anything at all) or when the effect you’re trying to measure exists, but is so small that it is hard to distinguish from no effect at all (which is what the null postulates). In these cases, we are at risk of making a Type II error. Anytime we say that we fail to reject the null, we have to worry about the possibility of making a Type II error, also called a false negative.",

But it is not the one we are asking here. We are simply asking, “Is there an association…” An association can go either direction. Perhaps more male candidates were promoted. But it would also qualify as an association if more female candidates were promoted. The wording of the research question indicates that we will need to perform a two-sided test.\nNote that there is some mathematical formatting below. As mentioned before, this is done by enclosing such math in dollar signs. Don’t worry too much about the syntax; just mimic what you see in the example.",

(However, do not put that command here in a code chunk. The Quarto document has no way of displaying a help file when it’s processed.) You can also type that into the Help tab in the lower-right panel in RStudio.\nThe help file doesn’t say too much, but there is a “Source” at the bottom. We can do an internet search for “Rosen Jerdee Influence of sex role stereotypes on personnel decisions”. As many academics articles on the internet are, this one is pay-walled, so we can’t read it for free. If you go to school or work for an institution with a library, though, you may be able to access articles through your library services. Talk to a librarian if you’d like to access research articles. As long as you have the citation details, librarians can often track down articles, and many are already accessible through library databases.\nIn this case, we can read the abstract for free. This tells us that the data we have is only one part of a larger set of experiments done.\nThis is also the place to comment on any ethical concerns you may have. For example, how was the data collected? Did the researchers follow ethical guidelines in the treatment of their subjects, like obtaining consent? Without accessing the full article, it’s hard to know in this case. But do your best in each data analysis task you have to try to find out as much as possible about the data.\nIn this section, we’ll also print the data set and use glimpse to summarize the variables.\n\nsex_discrimination\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nglimpse(sex_discrimination)\n\nRows: 48\nColumns: 2\n$ sex      &lt;fct&gt; male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, m…\n$ decision &lt;fct&gt; promoted, promoted, promoted, promoted, promoted, promoted, p…\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Prepare the data for analysis.\nIn this section, we do any tasks required to clean the data. This will often involve using mutate, either to convert other variable types to factors, or compute additional variables using existing columns. It may involve using filter to analyze only one part of the data we care about.\nIf there is missing data, this is the place to identify it and decide if you need to address it before starting your analysis. It’s always important to check for missing data. It’s not always necessary to address it now as many of the R functions we use will ignore rows with missing data.\nThe easiest way to detect missing data is to try deleting rows that are missing some data with drop_na and see if the number of rows changes:\n\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSince the result still has 48 rows, there are no missing values.\nThe sex_discimination data is already squeaky clean, so we don’t need to do anything here.\n\n\n10.5.3 Make tables or plots to explore the data visually.\nAs we have two categorical variables, a contingency table is a good way of visualizing the distribution of both variables together.

All the data comes from a group of 48 bank managers recruited for the study, but one group of interest are bank managers who are evaluating male files, and the other group of interest are bank managers who are evaluating female files.\nOne of the contingency tables above shows the sample sizes for each group in the marginal distribution along the bottom of the table (i.e., the column sums). There are 24 mangers with male files and 24 managers with female files.\nThe populations of interest are probably all bank managers evaluating male candidates and all bank managers evaluating female candidates, probably only in in the U.S. (where the two researchers were based) and only during the 1970s.\n\n\n10.6.2 Express the null and alternative hypotheses as contextually meaningful full sentences.\n\\(H_{0}:\\) There is no association between decision and sex in hiring branch managers for banks in the 1970s.\n\\(H_{A}:\\) There is an association between decision and sex in hiring branch managers for banks in the 1970s.\nNote: The null hypothesis is indicated by the symbol \\(H_{0}\\), often pronounced “H naught” or “H sub zero.” The alternative hypothesis is indicated by \\(H_{A}\\), pronounced “H sub A.” The alternative hypothesis is the claim that we’re interested in proving; it’s the statement that we want to make if the answer to the research question is “yes.”\n\n\n10.6.3 Express the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols (when possible).\n\\(H_{0}: p_{promoted, male} - p_{promoted, female} = 0\\)\n\\(H_{A}: p_{promoted, male} - p_{promoted, female} \\neq 0\\)\nNote: This math looks very different in form and structure from the contextually meaningful full sentences above that just talk about “association.” We have to translate those sentences into something we can measure numerically. What would the numbers show if there were no association between decision and sex? If the null hypothesis were true, this would manifest as no difference between the proportion of males promoted and the proportion of females promoted. If the alternative hypothesis is true, there is a difference between these two proportions. The difference is not equal to zero.\nPay attention to the “success” condition (in this case, “promoted”). We could choose to measure either those promoted or those not promoted. The difference will be positive for one and negative for the other, so it really doesn’t matter which one we choose. Just make a choice and be consistent. Also pay close attention here to the order of the subtraction. Again, while it doesn’t matter conceptually, we need to make sure that the code we include later agrees with this order.",

That tibble is what we need to feed into the visualization later. However, for reporting the value by itself, we have to pull it out of the tibble. We will do this below using the pull function. See the inline code in the next subsection.\n\n\n10.8.2 Report the test statistic in context (when possible).\nThe observed difference in the proportion of promotion recommendations for male files versus female files is 0.2916667 (subtracting males minus females). Or, another way to say this: there is a 29.1666667% difference in the promotion rates between male files and female files.\nNote: it’s been a few chapters since we’ve seen inline code, so make sure you remember how it works. Inline code starts with a backtick followed by the letter r and a space. It ends with a backtick. Everything inside the two backticks must be valid R code. We should always check that our inline code works before moving on. We do this by placing the cursor somewhere between the two backticks and then hitting Ctrl-Enter (Cmd-Enter). Do that with both code chunks above to see that the codes works and generates the correct answer. If you get an error, fix it before moving on. Otherwise, the next place you’ll run into a problem is not until you go to “Render” the document. That will generate an error that is much more challenging to track down.\n\n\n10.8.3 Plot the null distribution.\n\nset.seed(9999)\ndecision_sex_test &lt;- sex_discrimination |&gt;\n  specify(decision ~ sex, success = \"promoted\") |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in props\", order = c(\"male\", \"female\"))\ndecision_sex_test\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\ndecision_sex_test |&gt;\n  visualize(bins = 9) +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_1, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In this section, we will use the series of verbs from infer to generate all the information we need about the hypothesis test. The first code chunk will generate the null distribution (in this case, by simulating 1000 random repetitions of the permutation process). We call that output decision_sex_test here, but you’ll change that to another name for a different test. The recommended pattern is response_predictor_test.\nDon’t forget to set the seed. We are using randomization to permute the values of the predictor variable in order to break any association that might exist in the data. This will allow us to explore the sampling distribution created under the assumption of the null hypothesis.\nThe second code chunk will allow us to plot the null distribution visually. When you get to the visualize step, leave the number of bins out at first. (Just type visualize() with empty parentheses.) If you determine that the default binning is not optimal, you can add back bins and experiment with the number. We know from the previous chapter that 9 bins is good here.\nIn the shade_p_value command, be careful about two things:\n\nThe obs_stat argument is used to tell R where our data is located. We stored that above as the variable obs_diff_1. When you do an example on your own, this will need to change to a different value (like, maybe obs_diff_2).\nLook carefully at the direction. In the previous chapter, we used “greater” because our question was only about more males getting promoted. Here, though, we are conducting a two-sided test, so we have to change direction to “two-sided”.\n\nIn the output, you’ll note that there is light gray shading in both tails. This is because we are conducting a two-sided test, which means that we’re interested in values that are more extreme than our observed difference in both directions.\n\n\n10.8.4 Calculate the P-value.\n\nP_1 &lt;- decision_sex_test |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_1, direction = \"two-sided\")\nP_1\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote: Again, be careful to watch for the two things mentioned above: 1. change obs_stat to match your data; 2. check that the direction is consistent with your choice of a one-sided (“greater” or “less”) and two-sided (“two-sided”) test.\nAs with the test statistic earlier, the P-value appears above in a 1x1 tibble. That’s fine for this step, but in the inline code below, we will need to use pull again to extract the value.\n\n\n10.8.5 Interpret the P-value as a probability given the null.\nThe P-value is 0.048. If there were no association between decision and sex, there would be a 4.8% chance of seeing data at least as extreme as we saw.\nSome important things here:\n\nWe include an interpretation for our P-value. Remember that the P-value is the probability—under the assumption of the null hypothesis—of seeing results as extreme or even more extreme than the data we saw.\nThe P-value is less than 0.05 (just barely). Remember that as we talk about the conclusion in the next section of the rubric.\n\nTake a second to check that the inline code works. Put the cursor in both inline code chunks and hit Ctrl-Enter (Cmd-Enter). When you’re doing this on your own, don’t move on if you have errors in your inline code!",

If we reject the null, then we have sufficient evidence for the alternative hypothesis. If we fail to reject the null, we have insufficient evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Either way, though, this contextually meaningful conclusion is all about the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\n10.9.3 Express reservations or uncertainty about the generalizability of the conclusion.\nWe have some reservations about how generalizable this conclusion is due to the fact that we are lacking information about how representative our samples of bank managers were. We also point out that this experiment was conducted in the 1970s, so its conclusions are not valid for today.\nNote: This would also be the place to point out any possible sources of bias or confounding that might be present, especially for observational studies.\n\n\n10.9.4 Identify the possibility of either a Type I or Type II error and state what making such an error means in the context of the hypotheses.\nAs we rejected the null, we run the risk of committing a Type I error.

    "text": "10.10 More on one-sided and two-sided tests\nI want to emphasize again the difference between conducting a one-sided versus a two-sided test. You may recall that in “Introduction to simulation, Part 2”, we calculated this:\n\nset.seed(9999)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  specify(decision ~ sex, success = \"promoted\") |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in props\", order = c(\"male\", \"female\")) |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_1, direction = \"greater\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe justification was that, back then, we already suspected that male files were more likely to be promoted, and it appears that our evidence (the test statistic, or our observed difference) was pretty far in that direction. (Actually, we may get a slightly different number each time. Remember that we are randomizing. Therefore, we won’t expect to get the exact same numbers each time.)\nBy way of contrast, in this chapter we computed the two-sided P-value:\n\nset.seed(9999)\nsex_discrimination |&gt;\n  specify(decision ~ sex, success = \"promoted\") |&gt;\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in props\", order = c(\"male\", \"female\")) |&gt;\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_1, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe only change to the code is the word “two-sided” (versus “greater”) in the last line.\nOur P-value in this chapter is twice as large as it could have been if we had run a one-sided test.\nDoubling the P-value might mean that it no longer falls under the significance threshold \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (although in this case, we still came in under 0.05). This raises an obvious question: why use two-sided tests at all? If the P-values are higher, that makes it less likely that we will reject the null, which means we won’t be able to prove our alternative hypothesis. Isn’t that a bad thing?\nAs a matter of fact, there are many researchers in the world who do think it’s a bad thing, and routinely do things like use one-sided tests to give them a better chance of getting small P-values. But this is not ethical. The point of research is to do good science, not prove your pet theories correct. There are many incentives in the world for a researcher to prove their theories correct (money, awards, career advancement, fame and recognition, legacy, etc.), but these should be secondary to the ultimate purpose of advancing knowledge. Sadly, many researchers out there have these priorities reversed. I do not claim that researchers set out to cheat; I suspect that the vast majority of researchers act in good faith. Nevertheless, the rewards associated with “successful” research cause cognitive biases that are hard to overcome. And “success” is often very narrowly defined as research that produces small P-values.\nA better approach is to be conservative. For example, a two-sided test is not only more conservative because it produces higher P-values, but also because it answers a more general question. That is, it is scientifically interesting when an association goes in either direction (e.g. more male promotions, but also possibly more female promotions). This is why we recommended above using two-sided tests by default, and only using a one-sided test when there is a very strong research hypothesis that justifies it.",

    "text": "10.11 A reminder about failing to reject the null\nIt’s also important to remember that when we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we are not saying that the null hypothesis is true. Neither are we saying it’s false. Failure to reject the null is really a failure to conclude anything at all. But rather than looking at it as a failure, a more productive viewpoint is to see it as an opportunity for more research, possibly with larger sample sizes. We never conclude that we have evidence in favor of the null hypothesis! At best, our data might be consistent with the null hypothesis. But that is not the same thing as proving the null hypothesis.\nEven when we do reject the null, it is important not to see that as the end of the conversation. Too many times, a researcher publishes a “statistically significant” finding in a peer-reviewed journal, and then that result is taken as “Truth”. We should, instead, view statistical inference as incremental knowledge that works slowly to refine our state of scientific knowledge, as opposed to a collection of “facts” and “non-facts.”\nIn fact, we won’t use the term “statistically significant” anywhere in this book. The word “significant” has the unfortunate connotation of “important.” A statistical finding might meet the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis without being a “large” or “important” finding. Instead, we will refer to results as “statistically discernible” when we reject the null hypothesis. We can only conclude that our data is mathematically unlikely given the null hypothesis, which means we can “discern” that the null hypothesis is not likely to be true.",

    "text": "10.13 Conclusion\nA hypothesis test is a formal set of steps—a procedure, if you will—for implementing the logic of inference. We take a skeptical position and assume a null hypothesis in contrast to the question of interest, the alternative hypothesis. We build a model under the assumption of the null hypothesis to see if our data is consistent with the null (in which case we fail to reject the null) or unusual/rare relative to the null (in which case we reject the null). We always work under the assumption of the null so that we can convince a skeptical audience using evidence. We also take care to acknowledge that statistical procedures can be wrong, and not to put too much credence in the results of any single set of data or single hypothesis test.\n\n10.13.1 Preparing and submitting your assignment\n\nFrom the “Run” menu, select “Restart R and Run All Chunks”.\nDeal with any code errors that crop up. Repeat steps 1–2 until there are no more code errors.\nSpell check your document by clicking the icon with “ABC” and a check mark.\nHit the “Render” button one last time to generate the final draft of the HTML file. (If there are errors here, you may need to go back and fix broken inline code or other markdown issues.)\nProofread the HTML file carefully. If there are errors, go back and fix them, then repeat steps 1–5 again.\n\nIf you have completed this chapter as part of a statistics course, follow the directions you receive from your professor to submit your assignment.",
